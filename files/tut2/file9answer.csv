Clive Palmer extends hand of friendship to Citic Limited

Mineralogy was ready, willing and able to listen to Citic Limited on how it could assist the Chinese company with its Sino Iron Project in Western Australia, Clive Palmer said today.
 
Mr Palmer confirmed he had written to Citic Limited suggesting a meeting to resolve any matters that were affecting the project.
 
""I am happy to travel to Perth to meet the Chairman of Citic Limited to address first hand if anything needs to be done to ensure the success of the Sino Iron Project,’’ Mr Palmer said.
 
Mr Palmer has released the letter that Mineralogy forwarded to the Chairman of Citic Limited.
 
""I hope the Chairman will take the time to meet with me personally to discuss all matters Citic Limited is concerned with and how we can assist Citic in achieving its commercial objectives.
 
""We can achieve much more by working together for the people of Western Australia and China.
 
“As Winston Churchill once said: To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war.
 
Mr Palmer said Mineralogy was open to do whatever was required to support Western Australia and the Western Australian community.
 
""I sincerely hope the Chairman of Citic Limited will accept my invitation to meet in Perth so we can jointly move the Sino Iron Project forward.
 
""Together we can achieve the extraordinary,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“The recent statements by the Chairman of Citic Limited that the Sino Iron Project may be closed is designed to intimidate Australian Courts and interfering with Australia independent Justice System.” The Chairman of Mineralogy Clive Palmer stated in Brisbane today.

“While the Chairman of Citic Limited makes such false statements in Australia he does not make them to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange which he is required to do by law if they were true.”

“Mineralogy has approved the Sino Iron Project as has the State of Western Australia in proposals submitted in 2006. The rational for the Chairman of Citic Limited statement has no merit.  It is just a response the Western Australian court orders which in effect require Citic Limited to pay over $100,000,000 on an interim basis pending a final trial in June 2017.

Mineralogy has granted the Sino Iron project the use of land sufficient for 3.9 million tonnes of stockpiles at the port of Cape Preston which has been approved for that purpose by the Western Australian government under section 45(c) of the EPA act. Sino Iron is producing less than 14 million tonnes of concentrate a year no more than (8%) of annual output is required in a port stockpile. Sino Iron has land for sufficient stockpiles for over 40 million tonnes of concentrate Production each year.”

Mr Palmer stated “The Chairman of Citic Limited continues to lie to the Australian people seeking to gain a commercial advantage and threaten Australia’s independence by manipulating public opinion . The Public Relations consultants for Sino Iron continual to distribute Fake News that the Australian press do not properly scrutinise. This Fake News in essence is a foreign governments propaganda designed to scare and mislead Australians and their elected representatives..”

“Since January 2016 the price of iron ore has more than doubled. Following the Western Australian Supreme Court ordering Citic parties to pay Mineralogy US$6 a tonne on future exports of concentrate, Sino Iron’s revenue has increased by more than $500 million dollars a year from January 2016 after deducting the $6 payment. The Chairman of Citic Limited says he may close the project down.  Why? Because Citic is earning an extra $500 million a year? 

The chairman of Citic speaks with a forked tongue. The Chinese Government owned company should stop misleading the Australian people and respect them and our Legal system and ways of doing business in Australia if Chinese State Owned companies want continued to access Australian resources.” 

Mr Palmer went on to say. “Australian companies are denied the opportunity of safely investing in Chinese resources yet Chinese Government owned Companies operating in Australia continue to do their Governments bidding at the expense of Australian jobs and the Nations integrity.”",,

It is with great sorrow that we are now attempting to come to terms with the loss of Peter Lynch, who passed away in a tragic accident in Perth yesterday.

Peter was well known and respected in the mining community throughout Australia and South East Asia.

Peter studied at the University of New South Wales, graduating in 1988, with a degree in mining engineering. He made his mark early in life, being elected as University President in 1985 and later becoming a Board member and Chairman of the University of New South Wales Student Union.

Peter commenced his career as an open cut mining engineer in 1989 at German Creek Coal Mine, managed by Shell subsidiary Capricorn Coal Management Pty Ltd. He quickly advanced through the ranks and carved out a career in underground coal mining, becoming a senior mining engineer and undermanager at one of German Creek’s underground mines known as Central Colliery, where he worked until 1993.

Peter’s ingenuity, business savvy and entrepreneurial spirit allowed him to design, develop and manage a variety of large scale underground and open cut coal projects in the Bowen Basin between 1994 and 2005, notably Oaky North Underground and Moorvale Open Cut, where he held roles as General Manager and Managing Director.

In 2006, Peter joined the ranks of Waratah Coal Pty Ltd as Managing Director and provided Waratah with a vision to develop the Galilee Basin as a vertically integrated mine, rail and port project. His dedication to the Galilee Basin and Waratah allowed him to strike up strong enduring relationships with many State Owned Enterprises from China. 

His enormous enthusiasm for the business and the Galilee Basin, provided Waratah with the platform to launch what can only be described as a world class mineral resource and what will be one of Queensland’s greatest mine, rail and port infrastructure projects.

His zest for business flowed into his personal life, where his passions for restoring cars, boating and flying, were infectious. 

Our sincere condolences are expressed to Peter’s family and friends. He will be sadly missed by all who worked alongside him, especially by the Staff and Management here at Waratah Coal and the Mineralogy Group.",,

The Turnbull government has replaced Australian jobs with machines at Brisbane airport. Turnbull has eliminated hundreds of jobs by replacing Border Force  officers with machines,  effectively reducing security and services.

Turnbull has done this to promote the sale of automated equipment from overseas,  Clive Palmer stated in Brisbane today.
 
When I left Australia today there was four border force employees to deal with all traffic from Brisbane airport. The machines could not read my passport or the next passenger details either.

Australia will be the laughing stock of the western world if it persists with such a system. Tourism is now low on Turnbulls agenda. Even the copy cat name of border force is joke to all Australians and an insult to our National identity. We don't need to copy the US in creating aggressive forces that seek to persecute further than serve the Australian community.

Turnbull is a failure his government actions in axing Australian jobs for imported machines a disgrace.

If you’re travelling during the day overseas, I suggest a person should arrive 2 hours early and expect delays while poor Australian public servants dressed up in blue uniforms with gold braid struggle with Technology they don't understand that doesn't work.

My staff and other witnesses will co-operate with the council and support Tom Tate's leadership to ensure the safety of all the residents of the Gold Coast.

Consultants and my employees observed them. They removed the carcasses of at least ten red deer from inside my property boundary and investigations have revealed they sold the meat from those animals to Gold Coast restaurants at up to $40 per kilogram.

The potentially murderous actions of those officers needs to be investigated and stopped. Tom Tate, the Mayor of the Gold Coast needs to take immediate executive action.

Small children under 10 years of age reside on my property and could have been killed by this raid.

Regardless of peoples political views, the use of weapons and discharging of firearms inside a person’s property is a criminal offence. I intend proceeding actions through the courts against the Gold Coast Council and their rogue killers and any cover up. I also intend to report this matter to police who have the duty to protect the residents of Queensland.

If guns are used to intimidate my staff and no action is taken to stop this, I will return to the political arena to change the Gold Coast Council for the benefit of all Gold Coast residents.

Small children and families should be able to play in their backyard without fear the Government will fire guns in or on their property.

Clive Palmer Returns to Canberra

Clive Palmer returns to Canberra today (Wednesday, November 9) where tomorrow (Thursday,

November 10) he will again challenge and seek to change Australia’s laws.

The former Member of the House of Representatives and one time holder of the balance of power in

the Australian Parliament will challenge in the High Court of Australia the validity of Federal

Government laws. The laws that are being challenged require Australians who have not been

charged with an offence to appear before a court and to be forced to answer questions.

“I am defending and protecting the rights of all Australians who should not be treated contrary to

rules of natural justice by a government system that does not care about the rights of individual

Australians,’’ Mr Palmer said in Canberra.

The High Court of Australia will hear the matter on the morning of November 10. The Australian

Government, the Queensland Government, the Victorian Government and the Government of South

Australia have all intervened trying to stop Mr Palmer setting aside laws which deny Australians

basic liberties.

The High Court of Australia has scheduled a full hearing before seven judges of the High Court and

six legal teams representing the various governments and parties opposed to Clive Palmer’s

challenge.

Andrew Cook, Mr Palmer’s media representative stated: ‘”What is interesting is that the media has

not reported on this serious challenge to the system in Australia where Australian citizens can be

forced to attend and answer questions by governments against their will and interests.

“It’s a case of the government becoming all-powerful to crush the individual. Mr Palmer believes it’s

an abuse of the courts of Australia to be used to interrogate people and then following the

interrogation to sit and decide matters affecting their liberty.

“It takes some one of Clive Palmer’s courage to come forward and seek to stop injustice,’’ Mr Crook

said.

Mr Palmer says he was attacked by both sides of politics when his nickel refinery closed before the

last election. Yet despite major investigations by government directed by the Treasurer and the

Prime Minister nothing of any substance has emerged against him.

“That’s politics in Australia. Both sides work together and lie to the Australian people. I know what

Australians think of their Members of Parliament. Everyone knows Members of Parliament are only

in it for themselves,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“We need an Australia where public service is the highest calling. Where people are not personally

attacked because their views are different to others.

“We need a united country with a common purpose to do what is best for Australians. There are

millions of Australians serving this country. It not just about who is in parliament. The fact that the

High Court is hearing me tomorrow is a healthy sign for justice in this country. All Australians have

the right to be heard.

“If my challenge in the High Court of Australia is successful it will be the first step in changing

Australian laws where no Australian should be examined in court unless they have done something

wrong and been charged with an offence, and they know what the case is they have to answer.

“It makes you feel ashamed to live in a country where democracy is just a game.” Mr Palmer said.

The reports in the media today are disappointing and confirm the ongoing campaign against me and my commercial interests by my former political opponents because of my public service. 

A number of matters should be self-evident.

The refinery is not operating and has not operated under the current holder of the environmental authority, Queensland Nickel Sales.

No nickel has been produced. The sampling points are publicly known.

There was no nickel at the sampling site when it was last sampled in November before the current reported occurrence. There has been no nickel production at the refinery by Queensland Nickel Sales.

I believe the sample of less than half an ounce got there because someone put it there. This is an ongoing political campaign of lies and misinformation which is not in the best interests of Queensland and future employment in North Queensland.",,

The leader of the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer, has spoken out against the Prime Minister for comments he made against Tony Jones on the ABC’s Q&A program last night.

""Turnbull's attack last night was an attack on the independence and integrity of the ABC and an attempt to bully Tony Jones,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“The Prime Minister’s conduct was a disgrace and a desperate attempt to ingratiate the ABC’s competitors such as The Australian and Fox programs including the Bolt Report and Paul Murray Live.

""As Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull has responsibility to protect and defend the ABC not drag it down for Liberal Party purposes. 

“His attack on the ABC shows how desperate the Government is getting as it faces a real prospect of returning to the opposition benches. 

“Tony Jones remains as one of Australia's truly independent journalists. All Australians must defend and protect freedom of speech especially when it comes under attack by the leader of the Government,’’ Mr Palmer said.

Glenn Lazarus was trying to steal Palmer United Votes in the senate election the federal leader of the Palmer United Party stated in Brisbane today.

 ""The former New South Wales state of origin player who switched State loyalty to stand in Queensland for the senate.""

He is a shocker he only got 6,000 votes in 2013 and if he did not get the 225.000 Palmer United votes he never would been elected.

""Lazarus misled our members to get endorsed.""

""He let them down by putting his personal interest before our party and grabbing the money.""

""He is only standing to get entitlements when he retires. You just can't trust the fellow"" Mr Palmer said

Clive Palmer announced in Brisbane today that he and two of his companies would serve a statement of claim in coming weeks seeking $1.2 billion in damages from John Park, his colleagues and FTI in respect of their administration of Queensland Nickel and the illegal diversion of the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture Funds and assets. 

Causes of action will include aiding and abetting a breach of trust and causing serious breaches of the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture Agreement by Queensland Nickel.

""Park has opposed the appointment of a special purpose liquidator by the Commonwealth to cover up his wrong doing and has sought to convince the creditors’ committee of Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd (QN) to oppose it,” Mr Palmer said.

“John Park has done this for one purpose only and that is to hide his criminal actions and diversion of joint venture funding from a new liquidator. 

“In short, Park lied in his report as administrator to creditors including the Commonwealth."" 

Mr Palmer said the special purpose liquidator should commence proceedings against Mr Park to recover the worker entitlements caused by his closing down of the refinery and sacking the workforce in breach of the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture Agreement.

He said the refinery would still be operating if Mr Park hadn't sacked everyone.

""It was John Park who caused an unlawful breach of trust and contract disregarding the lawful rights of joint ventures to close the refinery and dismiss the workforce causing social upheaval to fill his own pockets,’’ Mr Palmer said.

""Park knows that if he had acted in accordance with the law, the closure and dismissal of the workforce didn't have to happen. Park and FTI need to be brought to account for their actions.

""ASIC has previously stated it was concerned that John Park and FTI were not putting the interests of unit holders before their own.

“I note the findings of the Honourable Justice Jean Dalton of the Queensland Supreme Court who stated when referring to Mr Park in relation to the LM funds case:  ‘The administrators of (LM) have in my view, demonstrated a preparedness to act in a way inconsistent with those owing a duty as a responsible entity and trustee under the Corporations Act. My view is that they have preferred their own commercial interests to the interest of the fund’,’’ he said.

""Park is at it again. He should have lost his licence following the LM scandal and been removed by the Supreme Court of Queensland as administrator but ASIC failed to act. If they had, thousands of jobs in North Queensland would have been preserved.

""The role of an administrator should be to do everything possible to preserve, protect and defend a business and to keep it operating, not to destroy it as Park has done.

“Park has, like the Supreme Court found in the LM case, preferred his own interests over the lives of so many families in Townsville,’’ Mr Palmer said.

""John Park and FTI have a serious conflict of interest. He should resign as liquidator of Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd in favour of the Commonwealth Government nominated liquidator. 

“Park cannot continue to draw millions of dollars in fees while he personally faces serious claims in the Supreme Court of Queensland from the Joint Venture parties over his disgraceful conduct as administrator of Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Why did he do it? It's time to follow the money.”

Malcolm Turnbull must resign as Prime Minister and follow the example given by other world leaders who have been caught up in the Panama Papers Tax avoidance Scandal Clive Palmer, the leader of the Palmer United Party said in Brisbane today.

How can Turnbull stay in the High office of Prime Minister when it's been revealed that as managing Director of Goldman Sachs he was a director of offshore companies designed to avoid Australian Tax. 

The fact that he did this when he was head of a major merchant bank is disgraceful. 

He was obviously encouraging his clients to shovel money off shore away from Australia and our economy. 

I can now understand why he doesn't want inquiry into the banks.

I will be having further discussions today with Senator Wang to see what we might do to bring the Prime Minister to account. 

Take your pick; illegal campaign funding , tax avoidance, or money laundering the liberal party has got the lot.

57% of the Liberal party donations have not been declared, months after being requested by the Australian Electoral Commission just cloud even further the Leadership of the Prime Minister.

Turnbull's investments are still in the Cayman Islands not Australia.

Former life member and party spokesperson for the LNP, Clive Palmer, said the Arthur Sinodinos funding scandal showed he made the right choice in resigning from the Liberals before the last Federal Election.

“As a life member I resigned because of the party’s poor corporate governance and arrogant disregard for accountability,” the Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax said.

As the largest Liberal Party donor at the time, Mr Palmer confirmed he had spoken to the former Liberal Party Treasurer Michael Yabsley about seeing the party’s accounts.

Mr Palmer said he was concerned that funds weren’t being used appropriately.

“I was worried about the possibility of party funds being siphoned off for non-proper purposes. This was of grave concern to me,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“The Liberal Party is a party of lobbyists, with only 43% of donations it receives being declared to the Electoral Commission.

“The Palmer United Party declares 100% of all donations, something that every party needs to do for the sake of democracy.

“When donations are not fully declared, serious questions must be raised into the awarding of contracts worth billions of dollars, that’s why complete transparency is needed.

“The Federal Cabinet Secretary Arthur Sinodinos has refused to appear before a Senate Committee investigating political donations.

“His refusal to front a parliamentary inquiry into political donations despite the Senate directing him to is very questionable.

“These serious issues need to be investigated by the Federal Police,’’ Mr Palmer said.

Clive Palmer blasts submarine decision

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said today the Federal Government had made a poor decision in awarding the $50 billion Australian submarine contract to French shipbuilder DCNS.

“This is a terrible decision which was only made to help win votes for the Liberal Party and Christopher Pyne in South Australia,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“The French have never undertaken a submarine project of this size before.

“Australian defence is too important; one must ask questions about the timing of this announcement.

“This decision is nothing short of disgraceful and clearly shows the Australian Government is putting votes ahead of national security.

“It is a shocking example of pork barrelling,’’ Mr Palmer said.

Stronger Communities Programme Funding Secured for Men’s Shed Nambour: Clive Palmer MP

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer MP congratulates the Nambour Men’s Shed on securing funding from the Stronger Communities Programme. 

Mr Palmer said that since its establishment in 2007 the Australian Men’s Shed Association has been playing an integral part in our communities.  It provides a safe haven where men can find social support and companionship with one another.

“It is extremely encouraging to see the money being allocated to such a worthy organisation,” he said.

The grant will enable the Nambour Men’s shed to build three pergolas which will be a community space where members can gather to share comradery over a cup of coffee and food while fixing the world’s problems.

On behalf of the Nambour Men’s Shed, Ian Ellis the President said, “we would like to thank the local member for Fairfax and the Commonwealth Government for making this grant available.”
“It is always difficult for a Men’s Shed to raise money, particularly for infrastructure projects. We are extremely pleased to be supported in this way.”

Mr Palmer said, “what is most uplifting about this project is the use of recycled material from a local demolition yard here in Nambour.’

“In this day and age, a strong focus on recycling must be a priority for all, individually and collectively, to ensure our world a better future,” Mr Palmer said.

A full audio will be uploaded in a separate post.

This address is given today because the Leader of the House, Christopher Pyne, would not consent to me making a statement in respect of Queensland Nickel. I thought considering the misinformation that the government had distributed, I need to set the record straight.

Just before the 18th of January 2016, Clive Mensink, the managing director of Queensland Nickel made 232 people redundant from Queensland Nickel. Mr Mensink ensured that when they left the refinery they had been paid two weeks wages in advance. He then appointed the Administrator and directed that worker entitlements be immediately calculated. Once the entitlements were calculated they were given to the Administrator who decided not to pay them. The management of Queensland Nickel had no control over the company once they appointed the Administrator. On the 18th of January 2016, in an effort to save the continued operation of the plant, the management of Queensland Nickel placed Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd into administration.

The administration and operation continued until Mr Mensink was advised by John Park around the 1st of March 2016 that unless he received $10 million dollars that week he was going to close the refinery down. He made the same demand to the Queensland Government.

I did not want that to happen and had lost confidence in the Administrator to keep the refinery running.

On the 3rd of March 2016, the joint venture partners, QNI Resources Pty Ltd and QNI Metals Pty Ltd, 100% privately owned companies of mine, resolved to appoint a new company that was not in administration as manager of the joint venture.

I personally put up some of my private assets to secure a $23million line of credit I planned to make available to the new manager.

Under the Queensland Joint Venture Agreement, the old manager, Queensland Nickel, on the appointment of the new manager was required to transfer the joint venture bank account together with the other assets and general approvals that Queensland Nickel had to give to the new manager. 

The millions of dollars in the joint venture bank account and debtors when added to the 23 million dollars I had arranged through my own personal efforts would have allowed the business to continue and employ over 550 people. 

John Park decided he would not transfer the bank account of the joint venture to the new manager of the joint venture as he was legally required to do. 

In so doing, John Park preferred his personal fees over the rights of the 550 people to continue to be employed.  Instead of doing a handover John Park closed the refinery making 550 people redundant and John Park decided not to pay their entitlements. 

No one in any company I am involved in made that decision. John Park for two months worked as Administrator and charged $4.5 million dollars. 

John Park then produced a report which raised a number of serious issues in relation to me personally and my companies.

In his report he was seeking a further payment of $5 million dollars to act as a liquidator of Queensland Nickel. He requested these funds from the Liberal National Government. 

His main criticisms on me were that:
(1)  I acted as a shadow director of Queensland Nickel. 
(2)  That I and my company had siphoned money out of Queensland Nickel.
(3)  That Queensland Nickel was insolvent of 27th of November 2015 because of a demand that Queensland Nickel had received from Arizon.

Firstly, Mr Park stated that I had acted as a shadow director of Queensland Nickel.

Queensland Nickel was manager of the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture and was required under the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture Agreement to follow the direction of the joint venture committee of which I was the Chairman.

The agreement was drawn up in 1992 when the Queensland Government was a major shareholder of the joint venture.

Under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, Queensland Nickel was prohibited from owning any property or engaging in any other activity other than as manager of the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture.
All directions I gave Queensland Nickel have been in accordance with my role as Chairman of the joint venture committee which Queensland Nickel is contractually required to follow such directions related solely to the Joint Venture property.

This is well documented and was ignored by John Park. Through the time of his appointment, Mr Park never made such allegations to me because he knew they were false. Nor did Mr Park give me the opportunity to respond to them which natural justice requires.

This matter is of no concern to me whatsoever but has been used by my political opponents to try to destroy me and my party.
The report is an attempt to get the Federal Government to pay him $5 million to liquidate of Queensland Nickel.

In early December 2015, my company Mineralogy made application in the West Australian Supreme Court to get a payment of $60 million from the Chinese state-owned company Sino Iron owed to Mineralogy so the funds could be invested in Queensland Nickel. All that is on the court record.

The allegation that I or any of my companies have ever been the recipients of any funds from Queensland Nickel is just not true. The consolidated accounts of the joint venture companies, audited by EY clearly demonstrated that John Park made misleading and deceptive comments about this matter in his report.

Any payments that were made in 2013 to Palmer United Party were the funds beneficially owned by companies 100% privately owned or controlled by me who had no employees whatsoever.

The allegations made by Mr Park are completely false as all allegations made against me by the political parties I have endured over the last three years since I was elected to the House of Representatives. 

While Mr Park stated words to the effect that Queensland Nickel was insolvent because of a demand from Aurizon on the 27th of November 2015. He neglects to state that Aurizon agreed in writing to extend the date for this payment to be made to the 18th of January 2016.

There is no substance or finding in Mr Park’s report.

Consequently, the joint venture parties have commenced action in the Supreme Court of Queensland against the Administrators seeking appropriate orders and declarations.

We have commissioned PwC to complete and issue an independent report on the Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd solvency up until the appointment of the Administrator. We will release such report at the end of May 2016.

There have been over 22,000 workers made redundant in Queensland. The Commonwealth and State Government have done nothing to deal with this issue.

I met with the Prime Minister at his office in Sydney on the 9th of October 2015. I had had a series of discussions with the member for Herbert, Ewen Jones during the last quarter of 2015. Subsequently, I stated that falling world nickel prices and the consequences temporary closure of the nickel refinery in Townsville would have for the employment for 2,500 people. I told Ewen Jones the refinery paid $70 million a year in tax to the Commonwealth and $12.5 million to Queensland. With around $600 million in exports, it underpinned North Queensland’s economy, the refinery needed $20 million dollars to keep operating.  The member for Herbert was hopeless. His response was just leave it to the Prime Minister. The PM said because I was a member of parliament, it was not something the government would consider. When BHP decided to close the refinery in 2009 the nickel price was $7.50 a pound, in late 2015 it fell to $3.50. 

From 2009 to 2015 my companies have spent over 4 billion dollars keeping 2,500 people employed for seven years. Production costs dropped by 50%. Everywhere lies and falsehoods have been canvassed in the press and by government ministers and the media. There have been no findings against me by any court or any party, just speculation. If something which isn’t true was, matters which have no relevance to true facts.

No funds owned by Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd have ever been paid to me or any of my companies.  No person working for any companies of mine have ever dismissed workers and decided not to pay entitlements.   Manipulated commodity prices have destroyed our country.   China gives 30 billion yuan to their metals processing industry, the Canadian government gives free electricity to their resources industry, how can Australian industry compete? 
22,000 jobs lost in Queensland and a hundred thousand across Australia. We need action to save 14,000 jobs at Whyalla now. 

The Chinese steel industry is dumping its steel stock at less than it costs on the world market, to bring down the price of steel and eliminate competition, jobs and steel production in Australia, and the Australian Government does nothing but boast about a one-way trade agreement.

The media attention on Queensland Nickel allows the government to escape responsibility for doing nothing while Australian manufacturing industry is destroyed.

The Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry are just hopeless, they sit on their hands while Australians lose their jobs. The Government won’t even allow me a 15 minutes spot in this parliament to make a full explanation or deal with matters of national interest.

In 1970, the Queensland Government had provided a $43 million guarantee for Queensland Nickel. The Queensland Government and later BHP Billiton had been shareholders of Queensland Nickel when over 80% of worker entitlements had accrued but they had failed to provide for them.

It was Anna Bligh, the Queensland Labor Premier, that discussed with me purchasing Queensland Nickel and the joint venture in 2009 when BHP decided to close it. In 2009 the price of nickel was $7.50 per pound. It was around $3.50 per pound when the Administrator was appointed.

The nickel price crashed in October 2015. The consolidated group had net assets of $1.95 billion dollars. Mr Mensink determined he should seek a bank overdraft of 20-30million dollars.

He with the Financial Controller and myself, visited six banks who all stated they were not prepared to lend to resource companies in Queensland.

As the Queensland Government had originally set up the refinery with a $43 million guarantee for 2 years in 1970’s and had been a major shareholder in 1992, setting up the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture Agreement and Queensland Labor Premier Anna Bligh had secured my investment in the business in 2009. We informed the Queensland Government of the situation.

On the 30th of September 2015, meetings were held with the Queensland Government.  Meetings continued to be held up until late October seeking support to keep the refinery open.  This was because the banks funding was not available with the key banks and confirming that banks were not lending.

In September 2015, the auditor EY signed the joint venture accounts stating 1.95 billion dollars in net assets. At the beginning of October, the forecast for the coming year showed a surplus of over $60 million was expected.

Malcolm Turnbull
When Malcolm Turnbull decided to challenge Tony Abbott for the Prime Ministership, he said he did it to bring about economic change.  Since then he has done nothing for our economy. Right across this country, companies are placed in liquidation, plants close and jobs are lost. The Australian Government needs to act.

Scott Morrison
He said that he would lean on ASIC to take action against me.  His comments are similar to Hitler when Himlar used the Gestapo in Germany. Independent government officers of the Commonwealth should be free from ministerial prejudice, interference and allow the rule of law to prevail in this country not political direction.

Senator Cash and Ewen Jones performance on this issue is disgraceful. It was Ewen Jones who failed to stick up for Townsville in November and December 2015, knowing full well the consequences of him failing to act for the people of Townsville. To now speak to the public about the suffering of families is disgraceful but typical of politicians in this place.  

For Senator Cash to say last week that this is the first time the Federal Government had to help is just a lie, even the media reports confirm the Queensland Premier discussed this with the Prime Minister late last year.  Again this is just political.

The fact of the matter is that I arranged for 12 billion dollars to be spent in this country in developing my iron ore leases in Western Australia.  These projects created around 60,000 jobs during construction.
Since 2009 we have spent over $4 billion dollars in keeping 2,500 people employed in Townsville for seven years. What have Turnbull, Cash and Morrison ever done? What jobs have they even established or created? It’s easy for them to criticise people who have created new jobs.

Australians need to understand that ongoing negative attitudes will mean the country will see that no one will ever invest in major projects again.  

It is better to invest in heavy industry in Canada, South Africa and China.  The Government needs to lifts its game and take action now to save the 14,000 jobs threatened in Whyalla.

There is a large team at the refinery in North Queensland attending to care and maintenance and ensuring compliance with environmental conditions.

The joint venture intends to reopen the refinery later in the year and create up to 1000 jobs in Townsville.",,Clive Palmer added 4 new photos.

Morrison abusing Ministerial power to lobby ASIC: Clive Palmer
 
Treasurer Scott Morrison was abusing his power as a Minister to lobby ASIC and make personal attacks over Queensland Nickel, the Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said today.
 
Mr Palmer said politicians from both major parties were engaging in a witch hunt against him to protect the two-party system rather than acknowledging the real reason for Queensland Nickel’s difficulties which was falling global commodity prices.
 
He said in the last 24 hours Mr Morrison, Michaela Cash, Bill Shorten, Brendan O’Connor and Ewen Jones had all attacked him personally over Queensland Nickel rather than deal with the facts.
 
“In just one example in the media today we see Scott Morrison abusing his power as a minister to lobby ASIC.  This is a blatant case of Mr Morrison using his office for an improper purpose to attack me personally for political reasons,’’ he said.
 
“He is attacking me when in fact he is hiding the short comings of his Federal Government in assisting the people of North Queensland.”
 
Mr Palmer said the Federal Member for Herbert, Ewen Jones, did not have any success lobbying his own government for assistance for the Townsville community.
 
“If assistance was provided we wouldn’t have seen job losses,’’ Mr Palmer said.
 
“The real story why Queensland Nickel is in receivership is because of the low commodity prices.
 
“The Chinese and Canadian Governments have helped resource sectors in their countries, so we aren’t on a level playing field.
 
“The Australian Government continues to be reactive instead of proactive, while job losses continue to mount up across the resources sector.
 
“We have seen 23,000 job losses in the resource sector in Queensland in the last 12 months and, most recently, the situation unfolding at Whyalla.
 
“This is a political witch hunt against me by politicians who want to keep the two-party system intact and reject any independent views,’’ Mr Palmer said.

(ii)        the entering into of contracts relating to the operation of the Joint Venture including the delegation of authority to the Managers or to one or both Joint Venturers to approve actions proposed to be taken pursuant to such contracts; and

(h)        to review and approve, with or without amendment, proposed budgets for Development Capital Expenditures and proposed revisions to Approved Development Budgets and provided in Clause 6.3.
 
 
Mr Palmer said the Joint Venture Agreement was signed in 1992.
 
“At no time did I need to be a director of QN to ensure that operations were carried out in accordance with the directions of the Joint Venture Owners Committee.
 
“Any activity that I have been involved in since 2012 was as a member of the Joint Venture Owners Committee carrying out its functions,’’ he said.
 
Clause 4.1 (a) states in detail the Joint Venture Owners Committee will be required “to provide the Managers with directions in respect of the duties and responsibilities of the Managers and to monitor the performance of those duties and responsibilities in accordance with directions given.”
 
The General Manager’s role is set out in Clause 5.2 of the Joint Venture Agreement and the General Manager (QN) role is set out in the Joint Venture Agreement as being “subject to the direction of the Joint Venture Owner Committee”. 
 
“QN was contractually bound to follow the Joint Venture Owners Committee in respect of Joint Venture business.
 
“QN is not and has never been a Joint Venturer. At no time was I a shadow director of QN,’’ Mr Palmer said.
 
“The accounts of my two private companies, QNI Metals Pty Ltd and QNI Resources Pty Ltd have been lodged with ASIC for the past six years and contain all transactions referred to in the Administrators Report.
 
“QN is prohibited by Clause 5.5(b) of the Joint Venture Agreement to carry out any other role other than Manager while it is Manager.
 
“The allegations contained in the Administrators Report do not related to QN activity. QN has never had any beneficial ownership in the assets of my private companies including cash at bank.
 
“For the avoidance of doubt, I attach a full copy of the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture Agreement. FTI and Administrators are not administrators or liquidators of any of the Joint Venture Parties.
 
“In September 2015, the auditor of QN signed the 2013 accounts for QN Group confirming solvency. The Administrator say because of a default notice by Aurizon, QN could be insolvent
 
“On page 44 of the Administrators Report, they say ‘The critical event which has driven the determination of the date of insolvency is the date Aurizon withdrew from the negotiated arrangements and issued a demand for payment of the total debt of $11.9M, being 27 November 2015’.
 
“What the Administrators do not say is that Aurizon agreed in writing to extend the time for compliance to 18th January 2016 so that a financing solution could be achieved.
 
“On 18th January 2016 when said solution was not achieved, the director then complied with his obligations and placed QN in administration. There was no insolvent trading,’’ Mr Palmer said.

Administrators’ report filled with untrue statements: Clive Palmer
 
Clive Palmer said today that the report released by the administrators of Queensland Nickel (QNI) contained a number of derogatory and untrue statements in relation to himself, QNI and others.
 
“The truth of the matter is the administrators are embarking on a campaign to secure more funds for their exorbitant fees,’’ Mr Palmer said.
 
“They have already paid themselves $4 million and are seeking to liquidate Queensland Nickel to pay themselves another $5 million.”
 
Mr Palmer said at no time in his dealings with administrators FTI Consulting did they raise any of the allegations now being made.
 
“The administrators did so without providing myself or others named in their report the opportunity to be aware of such allegations or discuss such matters.
 
“The report calls into question the professionalism and impartiality of FTI. Their findings are filled with innuendo.”
 
Mr Palmer said the public had a right to know the truth.
 
“Queensland Nickel employees who were first made redundant were paid two weeks wages in advance while their redundancy and entitlements were being determined.
 
“It was FTI who made the decision not to pay entitlements, not any person working for Queensland Nickel.
 
“FTI continued to trade the company for over a month with Joint Venture funds without the Joint Venture’s approval,” Mr Palmer said.
 
“On March 3, Queensland Nickel ceased to be the manager of the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture.
 
“The administrator refused to transfer the joint venture bank account to the new manager as required by the joint venture agreement,’’ he said.
 
Mr Palmer said he obtained a $23 million line of credit which when added to the joint venture bank account would have kept the refinery open avoiding further redundancies.

“Instead the administrator decided to sack all 550 employees, not pay their entitlements and to close the refinery.

“I want to be clear that at no time did I act as a shadow director,” he said.
 
Mr Palmer will later today release documents showing the role in which he acted, proving the allegations are false.

It seems the two party system in Australia doesn't want any competition and we continue to be attacked with allegations that are unfounded.

The truth is over 100,000 people have lost their jobs in the resources sector over the past few years and this government has got no policy to deal with or to support industry in this country. 

When other countries, such as China and Canada, invest money in their industry at times of downfall in the economy, to keep them going and to keep jobs, it creates an unfair market where Australian companies just simply cannot compete. 

Does this government really want to support jobs and industry in Australia? It doesn't seem that's the case to me.

Four Corners Needs to Give Clive Palmer a Fair Go
 
Clive Palmer has offered to appear on Four Corners live to answer allegations being raised by the program.
 
The program contains a number of factual errors and if broadcast will cause substantial damage to Mr Palmer.  Four Corners needs to be corrected.
 
In relation to Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd, the facts are that Queensland Nickel has never given loans to Mr Palmer or his companies.  Any reports to the contrary are false and have been written to cause malicious damage.
 
Queensland Nickel employees who were first made redundant were paid two weeks wages in advance while their redundancy and entitlements were being determined.
 
The administrator made the decision not to pay entitlements, not Mr Palmer or any person working for Queensland Nickel. The administrator continued to trade the company for over a month following that decision with Queensland Nickel funds.
 
On March 3, Queensland Nickel ceased to be the manager of the Queensland Nickel Joint Venture. The administrator refused to transfer the joint venture bank account to the new manager as required by the joint venture agreement.
 
Mr Palmer had obtained a $23 million line credit which when added to the joint venture bank account would have kept the refinery open avoiding further redundancies. Instead the administrator decided to sack all employees and close the refinery. If those people had kept their jobs they would not been eligible for entitlements.

The accrual of entitlements mostly took place under Queensland Government and BHP ownership, which they failed to provide. Any suggestion that Mr Palmer has or could have any liability is false and any serious suggestion that he for whatever reason has done anything but act honourably is untrue.
 
As is normal process, there is a report being released to creditors in the coming week by the administrators.
 
For the ABC to broadcast prior to the release of such a report is clearly designed to cause serious damage to Mr Palmer for an improper purpose. Why does the ABC choose to broadcast before and not after the release of the report?
 
Mr Palmer has offered Four Corners a live interview.  Four Corners refused to allow Mr Palmer to appear on the program when it is broadcast to answer any allegation.
 
Such refusal merely confirms Four Corners’ lack of willingness to deal with the truth and its determination to run a biased broadcast not in accordance with its charter.
 
Mr Palmer, like any Australian, should be entitled to a fair go.
 
The real truth is that as world commodity prices have collapsed and more than 22,000 Queenslanders in the mining sector have lost their jobs, neither the State nor Federal Governments have had a credible response.
 
The Chinese Government has provided 30 billion yuan of assistance to its metal industry and the Canadian Government is waiving electricity costs for their mineral processors to save jobs. The legitimate question is how can Australian industry compete with that?
 
The absence of similar coverage of the shareholders of the operations at Whyalla or the companies of the 22,000 sacked Queensland workers raises the question of whether the ABC is running this story for political purposes.  Considering the closeness of the current election and the lack of coverage by the ABC of the Palmer United Party’s political achievements, there appears to be serious issue of bias.
 
Mr Palmer repeats his request for equal time being allocated on any broadcast for him to appear in person and provide answers to any allegation on any subject. The refusal by the ABC to allow Mr Palmer to appear is unbalanced and a denial of the public’s right to know.

Pyne must answer for Whyalla job losses: Clive Palmer
 
Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer said recent job losses at the Whyalla steelworks had highlighted the Federal Government’s shocking lack of support for Australian industry.
 
“Federal Industry Minister Christopher Pyne has much to answer for over the 2000 jobs lost in Whyalla with Arrium going into voluntary administration,’’ Mr Palmer said.
 
“As job losses continue to mount up in the resources sector around Australia, the Liberal Government has been useless in shaping policy that reflects the current global downturn in commodity prices.
 
“The Chinese Government is spending $30bn to support mineral processing whilst the Canadian Government is waiving electricity costs for their mineral processors to save jobs and Malcolm Turnbull and Christopher Pyne stand by and watch Australian industry destroyed.
 
“Members of government should realise they are elected to do something and support Australian industry.
 
“We need a national policy for the resources industry given the global downturn. At present Australians are being played for mugs,’’ Mr Palmer said.
 
“22,000 jobs have been lost in the resources sector in Queensland and there has been no response from The Fixer, only criticism for those who want to keep industry going in Australia.”
 
Mr Palmer said it was hypocritical that Mr Pyne had received support from his government to help Whyalla steelworkers while nothing was being done to assist Queensland Nickel workers in Townsville.
 
“The Federal Member for Herbert, Ewen Jones, has failed to get the support of the Turnbull Government to help QNI and has let the people of Townsville down. The people of North Queensland should vote him out at the next election for failing them,” Mr Palmer said.
 
“What is good for Whyalla should be good for Townsville.
 
“Christopher Pyne seems to get all the support he needs. Is it because the Liberals are worried about him losing his seat to Nick Xenophon’s party?
 
“Mr Pyne and Mr Turnbull are playing political games with people’s lives,’’ Mr Palmer said.",,

Unfortunately, the Queensland Labor government did not transfer all the required approvals to operate the refinery, and the administrator froze bank accounts and cancelled ore shipments which also impeded the continued operation.

Governments around the world realise the value of industry and the jobs they create, they invest money to continue the operations of their metals industry whilst commodity prices are low. This creates a situation that makes it hard for any Australian company to compete in the current market. Our government fails to see the need to keep supporting jobs and growth for the economy.

When 5% of the population were voting for other parties than the majors, the government changed the law, so that you can put a 1 in the box above the line. This made it easier for people to vote and it made it easy for the major parties to have control.

Now, when there is 25% of the population that vote for other parties than the majors, they seek to change the law again to make it harder for smaller parties and independents to get elected. All so that major parties can take control again.

Firstly, the Liberals referred the legislation to the joint standing committee on monday, only to pass a motion on wednesday to pass legislation straight to the senate, without the committee review. Oh and they made six changes to the legislation as well.

The Greens have in principle given their support for this in the senate which will ultimately ensure Liberals control the senate for years to come. This will mean they will pass their agenda at will, or if they so choose, block any agenda proposed by Labor and Greens.

Not sure why the Greens wanted to jump into bed with the Liberals when the Liberals have clearly demonstrated they want to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Climate Change Authority and ARENA.

Palmer United saved all of these agencies in support of the environment and also ensured an ETS is under review and remained committed to sustaining the Australian environment.

In most macroeconomic models austerity measures generally increase unemployment as government spending falls, reducing jobs in the public and/or private sector. Meanwhile, tax increases reduce household disposable income, thus reducing spending and consumption.

Since government spending contributes to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), reducing the spending may result in a higher debt-to-GDP ratio, a key measure of a country's debt burden.

When an economy is operating at near capacity, higher short-term deficit spending (stimulus) can cause interest rates to rise, resulting in a reduction in private investments, which in turn reduces economic growth. In the case of excess capacity, however, the stimulus may result in an increase in employment and output.[4][5]

We need to stimulate domestic demand, turbo charge our economy and increase the amount of cash that circulates to improve our standard of living which in turn will grow government revenue which can be invested in our health and education sectors.

What the government is seeking to do is make it extremely difficult to impossible for those other than Liberal, Labor or Greens to be elected to the Senate. This would stop smaller and independent parties from being elected and holding the government accountable.

The changes will most likely mean that the Liberal Party will control the senate, and would be able to pass through all their Austerity measures such as those that were rejected after in 2014.

This would mean no school kids bonus, no low income support or super contributions, and people under 30 would have to wait 6 months before receiving any unemployment benefit.

The Greens also support the legislation that would also see the end of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, ARENA and the Climate Change Authority as Liberals tried to abolish these earlier too.

At both by-elections since Malcom Turnbull was elected Prime Minister, the government has experienced major swing against it. First in the seat of Canning, where the swing was 6.8 percent against the government, and then more recently in the seat of North Sydney, where the swing was 13 percent against the government.

Yet in the News Limited press and other media, Turnbull is supposed to have overwhelming support. It just doesn’t add up.

It’s a great time to be an Australian, Turnbull tells us, but it is hardly a great time for the 954,000 unemployed Australians and their families, or the millions on low income support or low income super.

Turnbull was clear from the start that he was there to implement Tony Abbott’s policy. Tony Abbott decided to hang around to contest the next election. If Turnbull decides to retire after next election and collect his investments in the Cayman Islands before moving to his apartment in New York to retire, Tony could be our next Prime Minister and implement the rest of his policy including the 2014 budget.

It is clear that the majority of the government, which includes the Nationals, support Abbott. Like all politicians, they first support their election.

Not a bad deal in your sixties to be given the Prime Ministership, even if only for 18 months, provided you don’t change policy, smile a lot and make announcements.

But it is still a cold winter in Tasmania, in the Latrobe Valley, in Elizabeth and in Redfern, in Western Queensland, and in the hearts of the men and women of Australia who have faith in our country and all it could be.

Leader of the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer, said today that the frenzied personal attacks on him were disappointing for Australia.

“There has been little discussion or attack at any policies of our party or what we achieved in Parliament. 

“Palmer United stopped the 2014 budget and saved this country from austerity,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“There is no truth or substance in the continuing false allegations and attacks against me. Personally I can understand how in the future Australians will not invest in their own country or seek to save jobs of other Australians considering the media coverage given to Queensland Nickel.

Dear Prime Minister

RE: Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd

Notwithstanding your or my comments in the press about the above matter, I am duty bound to write to you to make it absolutely clear so that you have the relevant facts of the matter.

In 2009, when BHP Billiton had decided to close the facility and devastate the North Queensland economy, the world nickel price was higher than US$7 per pound. Today, the world nickel price is US$3.80 per pound and the plant is still in operation, employing directly over 550 people and providing a further 1600 jobs from its activities to the people of Townsville.

In 2009, following discussion with the then labor Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, companies that I own agreed to inject tens of millions of dollars for the acquisition of Queensland Nickel and to operate it more efficiently and continue to impact the employment of thousands of people.

The productivity gained in the plant’s operations is the best achieved in any manufacturing facility in Australia, where the cost of production has halved in comparison to the cost of production under the former BHP management. The excellent work carried out by the management of Queensland Nickel has allowed over $4bn to be invested in North Queensland since 2009.

As you are aware, the management and workers of the plant can only concentrate on their cost base. As a 100% export plant, they are totally dependent upon the world commodity prices. During our meeting late last year in Sydney, I made you aware that the Nickel price had collapsed since October 2015.

The company’s auditors, Ernst & Young, signed an auditor’s report including solvency of the company in September 2015. At that time it was my understanding the company had projected a surplus of $73m for the year and, in the audited accounts, had a net asset base of $1.95bn and no substantial debt. It was reasonable to assume that a banking institution would have funded a small amount of debt on the balance sheet. For reasons best known to the Treasurer, they failed to do so.

In contrast to the Australian Government’s attitude in respect of our metals manufacturing industry, the Canadian Government has waived all charges for power and electricity for all their metals manufacturers due to the low commodity prices. The Chinese Government has provided CNY$30,000,000,000 directly to its metals manufacturing industry. It is disappointing that the Australian Government on this issue is more interested in taking cheap political shots against a management team that has worked so hard to achieve a positive outcome for the company and the country that the Australian Government has obfuscated its duty to ensure there is a level playing field for Australian manufacturers under the World Trade Organisation.

Other Issues

Whilst there have been other issues raised in the press, we have to remember that 22,000 jobs have been lost in Queensland in the resource industry because of declining resource prices, international manipulation of those prices and the failure of the government to even be alive to these issues. These are issues for which the Australian Government refuses to take any actions necessary to counterbalance the effect of these measures on our economy.

The media coverage of this matter has been politicised without addressing the real issues. From a policy perspective, there has been the redundancy of 237 workers in Townsville which has had the effect of preserving jobs for the 550 workers that are still employed directly by Queensland Nickel and jobs for the 1600 workers that depend upon the refinery operations in Townsville.

I have been informed that on the Thursday, when redundancies were carried out, each employee of Queensland Nickel was immediately paid two weeks wages in advance pending final calculation of their entitlements in accordance with the Fair Work Act.

During the period when calculating their entitlements, the director of the company, in accordance with obligations under corporation law, appointed an administrator to the company. That administrator then made the determination that workers’ entitlements would not be paid under the administrators and would be subject to a deed of arrangement. Neither the shareholders nor the management had any decision making powers over such matters and it is therefore very unreasonable for there to be any attack politically on the management of the company pending the outcome of the administrators’ report. There can be no doubt that in the years from 2009 onwards, when the company was subject to audit, that it met all solvency tests as certified by the company auditor.

There has been substantial comment by your ministers that raised the question whether a private family-owned company, which is certified as being fully solvent, has the right to donate funds to the political party of its choosing. As you should be aware, in the years prior to 2013, the political party which you lead, was the beneficiary of substantial donations from Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd. I have heard no such criticism in respect to those donations. Moreover, it is not reasonable or proper to make comments in respect of matters that are subject to any administrators’ report while that report is being compiled. 

As you are aware, as I have publicly stated at the time following my election to the federal parliament, I have retired from business. I am concerned with the decline of jobs in the country and the systematic failure of the Australian and State Governments to seriously address industrial policy in this country.

Yours faithfully,

When Clive Palmer’s companies acquired Queensland Nickel Pty Ltd (QN) in 2009, the price of Nickel was around $7 a pound. At the time I made the decision to make redundancies at Queensland Nickel the price had been as low as $3.50 a pound. In 2009 I estimate QN’s production cost was close to $8 a pound and seven years later it’s closer to $4 a pound. QN’s improvement and efficiency in productivity are the best in any industry in Australia during the period of ownership of Mr Palmer and that is a fact. 

In 2009 the Queensland Labor government wanted assistance in keeping QN’s operations going because of the significance to the North Queensland economy. In 2009, it was estimated that QN provide 2,400 jobs in the community. QN is the largest private employer in North Queensland and the largest user of the Townsville port. 

QN exports are between $600,000,000 and $700,000,000 each year and it provides approximately $1.4 billion dollars a year to the Townsville economy. QN workers’ pay approximately $50,000,000 each year in group tax and the company pays around $20,000,000 each year in GST. QN is responsible for payments of $12,500,000 a year to the Queensland Government.

The current structure under which QN operates was established in 1991 when the Queensland Government held more than 25% of the shares in QN and provided substantial guarantees to ore suppliers and other creditors. 

Since 2009 QN has invested over $4,000,000,000 in North Queensland’s economy by its operations and kept thousands of people employed each year, of which would have had no jobs over the last seven years if it was not for the actions of the new management of the company from 2009. 

While the press concentrates on issues which have no bearing on the operations or the decisions I took to place the company in administration, I thought this is a good time to set the record straight in respect of recent events.
 
(Refer to Graph from Picture 1)

Queensland 2015
In the last 12 months, around 22,000 jobs have been lost in the Queensland Resource sector primarily because of falling commodity prices. The media have failed to cover those tragedies and it’s disappointing how the media and politicians try to benefit from our company misfortune. It has been an extremely poor performance from government that there has been little to no real action to support the workers and the communities that have been devastated. 

Unfortunately, most of the companies have just closed down and closed operations permanently. The actions taken by QN needs to be seen in that light and it needs to be clearly understood by current and former workers and management of QN that what QN has done and what our strategy has been.
 
(Refer to graph from Picture 2 and 3)
 
The prime reason for QN administration and associated events is the price for Nickel, which is at its lowest for 15 years and as stated previously was around half of what it was when BHP wanted to close the plant. QN’s performance is more than twice as good as BHP’s management was when they had the plant the numbers prove it.
 
(Refer to graph from Picture 4)

During the weeks prior to the redundancies, the QN management team was working on plans to further improve our existing operations and identify how QN could keep the maximum number of people employed in this low Nickel price environment. Various options and cash flow models were considered and QN actively sought financial assistance, which was looking positive. 

I determined firstly on a cash flow basis there would have to be a reduction in workers and output to provide QN with a positive cash flow to continue. In this regard we had to make 237 employees redundant and when each of those employees was made redundant, they left their employment with two weeks’ wages which had already been paid in advance. I immediately took steps to have their entitlements calculated and I then had to consider the impact and likely impact on future creditors and other financial efforts. I formed the view that QN’s best chance of survival and restructure was for QN to go into administration.

Once the administrator was appointed he or she has the power to decide how entitlements will be dealt with, my powers as a Director are suspended during administration. When we consider that there is approximately 2,400 jobs in Townsville dependent on QN activities in one form or another, by reducing the QN workforce by 237 jobs and restructuring operations, QN has effectively saved 2,150 jobs by continuing to operate in administration. 

It would have been easier and less controversial to do what other resource companies have done and just closed operations and not be concerned about more than 2,000 families that depend on our operations.

We recently celebrated 40 years in operation in Townsville and I firmly believe QN is capable of operating for another 40 years. QN can emerge from this administration as a stronger company.

The reports in the Press about the management team are untrue. I hope the administration will properly investigate and deal with these matters. I have refrained from public comment and have not attended this meeting as, like many, I am a creditor of the Company. 

I, and our shareholders, wanted all creditors including the workforce to feel free to raise any concern they may have with the administrators without being in any way restricted by my or our shareholders presence at the meeting. The operations are ongoing and employ over 550 people and impact another 1,600 jobs in Townsville. Queensland Nickel must continue to provide the security for our community to function.

On a personal note how anyone could attack the strong commitment Clive Palmer has shown to Townsville since 2009 is difficult to understand. He invested his money to save our operations when no one else would. In good times he gave away 55 Mercedes Benz and over 1,300 overseas holidays to staff. While 237 jobs have been lost because of low nickel prices, we are trying to save over 2,000 jobs. I don't see anyone else trying save jobs in North Queensland.

Shorten shorts out over Turnbull lead

In a desperate move to try to regain relevance following serious lapses of memory in the Royal Commission into trade union corruption, former National Secretary of the AWU Bill Shorten is visiting Townsville to shift blame from the AWU for not supporting workers at Queensland Nickel, Clive Palmer, the leader of the Palmer United Party in the House of Representatives, said in Canberra today.

""Ben Swan and the AWU refused to pressure the Labor State Government to provide support to enable Queensland Nickel to continue to employ its full workforce in Townsville,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“In 2009 BHP was going sack 100 percent of the workforce when the nickel price was $7.  Now it's $3.80 and because of the good work the company has implemented, it is still in production providing 550 jobs for its employees and an additional 1600 jobs in Townsville.

""It was the Labor Premier and the three Labor State Members in Townsville that refused to even meet with the management of Queensland Nickel despite the fact that Queensland Nickel is the largest employer in North Queensland and had spent over four billion dollars in North Queensland since 2009,’’ he said.

""While companies outside Queensland Nickel have provided $250 million dollars in assets as security to support QNI and workers’ entitlements, the Queensland Labor Government has offered nothing other than advice on how to fill in applications for jobs that don't exist.

“Bill Shorten and his AWU are a disgrace. They have done nothing for 22,000 jobs lost in Queensland.

“Shorten should go back to the Commission and tell them the truth about the AWU and its corruption which puts workers’ interests last.

“I challenge the Premier to match my support for the company and put up or shut up.  She just doesn't understand business or care about workers. The last thing Townsville needs is politicians grandstanding over workers’ misfortune,’’ Mr Palmer said.

COOLUM Palmer Resort will be reactivated as a functioning tourism hub as soon as issues relating to Clive Palmer's dispute with President's Club unit owners are resolved.

Mr Palmer said he was hopeful matters could be resolved within six months but has made clear there will be no closure of the matter until the club was restructured as a body corporate, saying it was now functioning illegally.

""The President's Club on March 13, 2012 lost its ASIC approval to operate as a time share placing the way it now acts in breach of the Corporations Act.

At the same time the Ambassador's Club lost its exemption and is now a body corporate.

In contrast the President's Club wanted the resort to act with it in breach of the Corporation law.

We refused to do that because it would be unlawful.

We will go back to court. They should be restructuring as a body corporate then everyone would have access to their units.

They haven't paid for power and water and owe us $500,000.

No-one gets power and water for free. But that's a separate issue.

We can't work with or be part of an illegal time share. If they re-organise as the Ambassador's Club has done there is no problem.

Palmer Uses Own Money to Give Queensland Nickel Workers Christmas Pay

 THE CFO of Queensland Nickel, Daren Wolfe, revealed today that Clive Palmer and his family provided $2.5 million of personal money so workers could be paid prior to Christmas.

 Mr Wolfe also said that the reported donation to the Palmer United Party of $290,000 was not made on December 31, 2015, instead that was the date of a lodgement that reported  on the previous six months. He said the amount represented a cash payment as well as monetary value for goods and services in kind.

 Managing Director of Queensland Nickel, Clive Mensink, said that in the election year of 2013, the Palmer United Party stood for the abolition of the carbon tax which threatened to cost Queensland Nickel $24 million per year.

 He said the tax also threatened to cause large job losses across the Australian manufacturing sector.

“Queensland Nickel would not have been able to continue its operations with a carbon tax,’’ Mr Mensink said.

“As a company we made the decision to support PUP as one of its major policies was to abolish the carbon tax. At the time Queensland Nickel provided nearly 1000 jobs and a further 1500 positions as a result of its activities.

“The election resulted in the abolition of the carbon tax allowing Queensland Nickel to continue,’’ he said.

“The simple fact of the matter is in 2009 the nickel price was $7 per pound and BHP was closing Queensland Nickel down.  Clive Palmer at the request of the then Premier Anna Bligh invested into the refinery.

“Since then Queensland Nickel has spent more than $4 billion in the North Queensland economy and generated another $4 billion of exports for Queensland and Australia.

“Make no mistake Clive Palmer is a hero and the people of North Queensland should be happy that he intervened and put his money at risk,’’ Mr Mensink said.

“Clive Palmer owns 100 percent of the company and no mums and dads have invested nor have the banks lent Queensland Nickel a dollar. It is Clive Palmer’s own money and courage that have supported Townsville's community.”

Mr Mensink said the reason for the refinery’s hardship is that the nickel price is currently around $3.75 per pound compared with the $7 per pound when BHP was pulling out in 2009.

Meanwhile the Chinese Government is injecting 30 billion yuan into its metals industry, the Canadian Government is waiving electricity charges for its metals industry and the Western Australian Government has already foreshadowed assistance to BHP following industry speculation that its nickel losses would be in the order of $400 million this year.

""However the Queensland Government has made it clear despite the nickel price being at its lowest in 15 years it has no interest in assisting Queensland Nickle in providing continued employment for Townsville families.

""This stands in contrast to the $40 million-a-year cheque the Queensland Treasury writes each year to a multinational group for their Gladstone operations,’’ Mr Mensink said.

He said Queensland Nickel was the biggest user of the Townsville Port and if it stopped using the facility, the Government-owned asset would lose hundreds of millions of dollars.  Additionally, $70 million in taxes from Queensland Nickel would be lost and to replace this facility at a later time would cost in the order of $5.3 billion.

“Yet Labor and the Liberals just play politics and don't care about the Townsville community,’’ Mr Mensink said.

“The Queensland Premier and Townsville MPs have refused to meet me over these issues despite Queensland Nickel being North Queensland’s largest private employer.

“The truth is North Queensland has been discriminated against by politicians. If Queensland Nickel was in South East Queensland, I am certain that support would have been granted.

“My concerns and Clive Palmer’s concerns have always been for the people of Townsville and the workers of Queensland Nickel,’’ Mr Mensink said.

“These are the real issues, not the political propaganda rolled out by political party spin doctors,’’ he said.

Queensland Nickel Restructures for the Future 

Following announcements the Chinese Government was injecting 30 billion yuan (AUD $6.6bn) into its metals industry and the Canadian Government was waiving electricity charges for its metals industry, Queensland Nickel has been forced to take action to restructure its operations. 

The Western Australian Government has already foreshadowed assistance to BHP following industry speculation that its nickel losses would be in the order of $400 million this year.

""The Queensland Government has made it clear despite the nickel price being the lowest in 15 years it has no interest in assisting Queensland Nickle in providing continued employment for over 800 families in Townsville,’’ the Managing Director of Queensland Nickel, Clive Mensink, said in Townsville today.

""This stands in contrast to the $40 million-a-year cheque the Queensland Treasury writes each year to a multinational group for their Gladstone operations.

""Because of the current nickel price and because of the failure of our own government to offer any support for our company’s continued operations in Townsville, today Queensland Nickel has been forced to make 237 workers redundant,’’ Mr Mensink said.

“With the NSW Government supporting BlueScope and action by the Chinese and Canadian Governments, there was no way Queensland Nickel could continue to employ so many people without any support from the Queensland Government. 

""We only requested a $30 million guarantee to support our company’s borrowings backed by our large asset base. 

Queensland Nickel did not seek any money from the Government. The Treasurer should not put politics above people and their livelihoods,’’ he said.

Mr Mensink said it was a sad state of affairs that only industry in the south east corner of Queensland received the attention of the Government. He said North Queenslanders had every right to feel disappointed the Government had turned its back on them.

""Since BHP announced the closure of Queensland Nickel six years ago we fought hard to keep Townsville going,’’ he said. 

“Clive Palmer only supported Queensland Nickel and Townsville because of the request of former Labor Premier Anna Bligh. It is ironic that her Labor successor’s lack of compassion and caring for Townsville families has directly cost 237 jobs in Townsville.

“The Premier and all Labor State Members from the Townsville area have repeatedly refused to even meet with me to discuss this matter. 

""We now need to concentrate on ensuring the 2000 additional jobs that Queensland Nickel operations sustain in Townsville can continue.

“I will be taking steps in the next few days to do whatever it takes to continue Queensland Nickel’s contribution to the Townsville community.

“The Under Treasurer, Jim Murphy, a former canberra resident, said the Queensland Government would support workers, well it hasn’t. The Under Treasurer and the Labor Government he worked for have totally failed to act on helping workers. 

“I would like to thank those men and women of Queensland Nickel who we are losing today for their dedicated service and the contribution they made to the company.

“We will not forget you however we must now concentrate on doing all that we can in future to continue our operations in Townsville,’’ Mr Mensink said.

Queensland Government not supporting jobs in Townsville
It has become abundantly clear that the Queensland Labor Government does not support Labor voters and does not care about potential job losses in Townsville that would impact on thousands of families.

The governments of other nations such as China and Canada have responded to the global downturn in commodity prices by offering assistance to the resources sector, yet our government does nothing.

The Chinese Government this week announced that it was giving RMB30 Billion (approx. $AUD 6.5Billion) to support its metals industry and the Canadian Government has announced that it is waiving electricity charges for the metals and resources industry for the next year.

The Queensland Labor Government’s refusal to offer any assistance to Queensland Nickel is making it near impossible to compete in the international marketplace.

Former Prime Minister John Howard was wrong when he said China would become a free marketplace resulting in benefits for Australia. As we know, China is a controlled marketplace where major companies are state-owned and protected, making for an uneven playing field.

Australia is being placed at a distinct disadvantage and our standard of living is in jeopardy because of government inaction.

The Queensland Government needs to stop playing politics and start showing leadership and compassion for the people and economy of North Queensland.

It is disappointing that Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt has breached long held conventions to keep business discussions confidential.

By leaking his letter to Clive Mensink last night, Curtis Pitt has sent a message to any party wanting to invest in Queensland that he can't be trusted and has little regard for the workers of North Queensland. 

He seems to think it is okay to spend $40 million of taxpayers’ money to multinational Rio Tinto in respect of the Boyne Smelter at Gladstone, but offer no support to the residents of Townsville.

Queensland Nickel has spent nearly $4 billion in North Queensland since my company acquired it when BHP was going to close it. 

Queensland Nickel has over $1.95 billion of net assets and no debt. This valuation shows the Treasurer that there is no asset problem and these assets would secure any guarantee by the Queensland Government.

Previously the Queensland Government has provided support to Queensland Nickel when it had different shareholders.

I never would have saved the jobs of so many people in North Queensland if I knew at the time the Queensland Government had such little commitment to the people of the state.

I have retired from business and this is not about me. It is about the future of North Queensland.

$5.6 billion of infrastructure will have been wasted because of the Queensland Treasurer’s lack of ethics and lack of commitment to the people who elected him to serve.

It seems the Treasurer is more interested in his profile than looking after thousands of people in North Queensland.

Misinformation regarding Queensland Nickel 

It is time to set the record straight in relation to misinformation about Queensland Nickel.

It is evident that I am being personally attacked because I am a politician. The simple fact is I have not been a director of any of the companies I own since 2013 when I became a Federal Member for Fairfax.

I retired from business at that time to become a full time federal politician. Notwithstanding, comments continue to be made about me so I am going to respond.

Queensland Nickel is in a strong position, 2015 audited accounts by EY show the company has unencumbered net assets of $1.95 billion.

The Managing Director of Queensland Nickel, Clive Mensink, informs me that as a result of the low nickel price of approximately $3.50 a pound, the company is experiencing a small deficit in cash flow.

In the global downturn of commodity prices, many resource companies are facing difficult conditions.

Global miner Anglo American, which employs 150,000 people around the world, is reportedly laying off 85,000 staff worldwide, this is just one example.

The fact is, not a single job needs to be lost at the Townsville refinery if fairness and common sense prevails. 

Just like many companies with a strong balance sheet and small cash-flow deficit, Queensland Nickel approached the four major Australian banks for assistance.

Despite unencumbered assets of nearly $2 billion, it was denied a $35 million overdraft by the four major Australian banks. I have been informed Queensland Nickel was told that in the current investment environment they would not lend to a resources company.

With assets of almost $2 billion, Queensland Nickel’s balance sheet is strong. Banks are not supporting the resources sector, which is in a downturn cycle, as a matter of policy and this is a major problem. This should therefore be a matter of concern for both the Queensland and Federal Governments.

As a result of this concerning policy by the banks affects all Queensland resource companies, the Managing Director of Queensland Nickel, Clive Mensink, approached the Queensland Government.

At the request of the Queensland Government, Queensland Nickel allowed the Queensland Under Treasurer Jim Murphy to attend meetings with the four major Australian banks. 

The banks reconfirmed their policy in relation to lending to Queensland resource companies and stated if the Queensland Government acted as guarantor for the small amount of money being sought against unencumbered assets of $1.95 billion, the funds would be forthcoming.

At no time did Queensland Nickel request taxpayer funds, only a guarantee from the Queensland government and for security of the guarantee for $35 million, Queensland Nickel offered its balance sheet of nearly $2 billion.

In my assessment, this is a risk free proposition that would ensure the continued operation of the refinery.

Queensland Nickel is not asking for money like the $40 million a year the government pays to the foreign-owned Boyne Smelters in Gladstone.

It is shocking that Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt gives away $40 million each year to the foreign owned Gladstone smelter but has refused to support Queensland owned company Queensland Nickel, the largest employer in North Queensland.

Six years ago when I took over the refinery, the then Premier Anna Bligh did everything to encourage me to buy it and my personal intervention in 2009 when BHP was going to close the refinery saved thousands of jobs and the Townsville economy.

In the last six years the workforce has been exceptional in its efforts to bring the facility up to world class standards and create a debt free business with a strong balance sheet.

Australians need to stop knocking and politicians need to stop playing politics.  Far too many politicians are only interested in themselves and misleading media with political propaganda rather than solving real issues.

I have personally sourced meetings with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to help resolve this issue but she is continually not available or not interested.

It’s disappointing that the Premier and Treasurer Curtis Pitt do not seem concerned about the people of North Queensland, they obviously lack leadership and compassion.

It must be highlighted that Queensland Nickel contributes $1.6 billion to the Townville economy each year, it is responsible for approximately 722 direct jobs and at least 1,500 indirect jobs and all these workers have families. 

We estimate that Queensland Nickel positively impacts the lives of approximately 10,000 people in the local region.

The Queensland Government must support the people of North Queensland and the North Queensland economy. 

The Premier urgently needs to meet with myself or Clive Mensink, the Managing Director of Queensland Nickel, one of Queensland’s largest private companies for urgent discussions.

WA Supreme Court Throws Out Citic Claims against Clive Palmer
Clive Palmer has claimed yet another significant court victory against Citic Limited, with the Supreme Court of Western Australia yesterday dismissing claims brought against him by the Chinese state-owned company.

In what is becoming a regular occurrence following the Hon. Justice David Jackson’s finding in the Supreme Court of Queensland that claims against Mr Palmer over an alleged $12 million fraud had no substance, the Hon. 

Justice John Chaney of the Supreme Court of Western Australia has now struck out claims against Mr Palmer brought by the Chinese Government owned Citic Limited Companies of $200 million.

Justice Chaney stated in his judgement that claims for restitution by Citic Limited subsidiaries of significant outlays in relation to the mining project be struck out.

It was successfully contended that the basis upon which restitution was sought was simply unarguable.

Mr Palmer said in Canberra today it was a sad reflection of doing business with Chinese Government-owned companies that not only do some not honour their contracts with Australian companies, they seek to abuse our court processes and subvert our justice system.

“Citic in particular has over $160 billion in the bank. To put that in perspective, it is five times Australia's annual defence budget,’’ the member of the House of Representatives said.

“Citic will not hesitate to use those funds to try to crush Australian companies and destroy Australian jobs.

“The China Free Trade Agreement does not mean that everything in this country is free to Chinese Government-owned companies who pursue national rather than commercial objectives,” Mr Palmer said.

“What is more disappointing is the Australian law firms and senior barristers who prostitute themselves and abandon their training and obligations to the court to only engage in litigation which is brought for a proper purpose and is based in a legitimate claim. 

“They do a great disservice to the courts and our legal system. It is time they stopped chasing money for the sake of money and realised this country stands for more than that.

""The truth of the matter is that Citic Limited subsidiaries have shipped back to China over $700 million dollars of Australian concentrate from Mineralogy mining leases in Western Australia and refused to pay to Mineralogy the royalty agreed.

“They have repudiated their agreement with Mineralogy by not paying and now are committing a criminal offence by taking Mineralogy ore illegally,’’ Mr Palmer said.

Time to End the Table Games, says Clive Palmer
Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says the Opposition’s fixation with a $600 broken table showed how out of touch it was with the Australian people.

“Penny Wong has got it wrong,’’ said Mr Palmer of the Labor Senator’s use of Senate estimates hearings this week to probe the mysterious case of the marble table damaged during a farewell party for ousted PM Tony Abbott.

“What a waste of time and taxpayer funds pursuing this matter, they should be getting on with more important things and concentrating all their efforts on being an effective opposition,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Let’s do more for the Australian people instead of silly witch hunts.”

“Labor had no economic plan while in government and have clearly learnt nothing in opposition if this is how they are going to act.

“At least Malcolm Turnbull has a strategy and is showing a way forward, so let’s get on with it and stop these ridiculous distractions.”

Mr Palmer said the first responsibility for politicians was to help Australians.

Clive Palmer Sets up Legal Fund for Abused Refugees
Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, will set up a legal fund to help end the abuse of refugees held in off-shore immigration detention centres.

Mr Palmer said the allegations of torture and abuse of refugees including women and children at Manus Island and Nauru were a crucial test for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his government ministers to show compassion and leadership.

“Mr Turnbull and his ministers are family people, mothers and fathers. It’s time they showed their hearts and ended this shocking chapter in Australian history by confronting the truth of how asylum seekers are being treated,” Mr Palmer said.

“Immigration Minister Peter Dutton needs to act decisively to end this shame.

“If Australia prides itself on being a just and humane society, the torture and mistreatment of refugees cannot be tolerated for a day longer.”

Mr Palmer also said the Australian Border Force Act which threatens workers with imprisonment for speaking out against conditions inside the detention centres was an affront to our core freedoms as a nation. 

Mr Palmer said he would set up a legal fund for refugees to gain access to court representation so their cases could be heard.

“Let’s get to the bottom of this and let justice prevail,’’ he said.

“The Commonwealth Government should be held accountable in the courts over these matters.

“Too often in my electorate and right around Australia people tell me they are fed up with government representatives acting only for themselves.

“This is a chance to show some humanity and government ministers who are doing the wrong thing need to be exposed.”

Urgent Changes Needed for Policing of Domestic Violence

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, today said the state police ministers must make domestic violence a number one priority in police matters.

Mr Palmer said despite the government’s recent policy push, police still assign a lower priority to domestic violence than other forms of violent behaviour.

He said there still remains resistance among police when handling domestic disputes, with police responses merely involving noting the crime and referring the victim to counselling. 

“Women and children’s lives are being placed at risk because police forces in the states are not accepting full responsibility for the issue,” Mr Palmer said.

“I’m calling on the Prime Minister to review all police procedures on how domestic violence matters are handled.

“Domestic violence should be treated like any violent offence and rigorous action must be taken to strengthen the response of government authorities and agencies to such a crime.”

Mr Palmer said police commissioners must immediately form an audit task force on this matter to ensure all cases are responded to with priority, investigated in full and followed up.

“Regardless of resources and budgets, police should be responsible for protecting the women and children of this country,” he said. 

“I’m calling on the Prime Minister to commit real resources to this issue; $100 million is a good start but this only equates to 3.5 cents for each Australian.

“I believe the children and women of Australia are worth far more.

“This issue needs to be taken seriously and given the highest priority. Action needs to be taken not next year, not next month, not next week, not tomorrow, but today.”

Mal Brough Should Stand Aside from Ministry Positions: 
Clive Palmer

Palmer United Party federal leader and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said the Member for Fisher Mal Brough continues to be under investigation from the Australian Federal Police.

The AFP is investigating Mal Brough after Labor MP Graham Perrett filed a second complaint against him after his involvement in the demise of former federal Speaker Peter Slipper.

Mr Palmer said the AFP has confirmed they are still investigating Mal Brough over ‘Ashbygate’, a year after a second complaint was raised about him.

“Mal Brough should stand aside from his ministry positions as Special Minister of State and Minister for Defence Materials & Science whilst he is under investigation from the AFP,” Mr Palmer said. 

“It was disappointing to see Mal Brough take on key leadership roles in Malcolm Turnbull’s cabinet.”

Mr Palmer said this is not the first time Mal Brough has made questionable and disappointing decisions.

“Mal Brough told current affairs program 60 Minutes that he had directed Mr Slipper's former media advisor, James Ashby, to obtain copies of Mr Slipper's diary,” he said.

“Mr Brough told 60 Minutes he was doing it for the sake of the electors of Fisher, whom he now represents, because he believed Mr Slipper may have been committing a crime.

“The people of Fisher who are in the neighbouring electorate to my seat of Fairfax on the Sunshine Coast deserve some answers and Mal Brough should not be accepting leadership roles while he is under investigation from the AFP.”

Award for Fairfax Special Olympics Athlete 

Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer has presented Kie Wilson-McNaught with a Sport Achievement Award in recognition of his outstanding sporting contributions at state, national and international levels. 

Kie (25), was diagnosed at age three with muscular dystrophy and told he would likely be wheelchair-bound by the age of six. Thankfully, Kie’s exceptional dedication and commitment to sport have delivered a more positive outcome.

In October 2014, Kie represented Queensland at the Special Olympics National Games in Melbourne, where he won two golds, one silver and two bronze medals in various athletic events. He was subsequently selected as one of only four men to represent Australia at this year’s Special Olympics World Games 2015 in Los Angeles, where he achieved fourth place in shot put, sixth in the 100m sprint and fourth in the 100m relay. 

In addition, Kie also competes at state level in basketball, swimming and athletics, as well as volunteering his free time to staff and students at the Sunshine Coast Riding for the Disabled at North Arm.

Kie’s mother and coach, Robyna McNaught, is confident her family’s philosophy of ‘if you stay active, you’re set for life’ prevented Kie from becoming confined to a wheelchair and gave him the determination to achieve his ambitious goals.  

“I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to Kie and his mum whose dedication, enthusiasm and countless hours of training have paid off with performances to be proud of,” Mr Palmer said.

“It’s young Australians like Kie who serve as an inspiration to all individuals with disabilities. He is a true ambassador for the youth of Fairfax and should be very proud of his achievements to date.
 
“This just goes to show that anything is possible no matter what life throws at you, and I wish him every success for the future.”

The Australian Government’s Sport Achievement Award was introduced in 2002 to recognise outstanding sporting performances, achievements and contributions by community members.

Nick Xenophon has Sour Grapes: Clive Palmer

Member for Fairfax and Palmer United Party federal leader, Clive Palmer, said Nick Xenophon is still bitter that he failed to get any Senator other than himself elected to the Senate at the last federal election. 

Mr Palmer said if the proposed Senate election reforms that Nick Xenophon supports applied, then he never would have been elected to public office at all.

“Nick Xenophon and Mal Brough are seeking to rig the next Senate election for their own political purposes,” Mr Palmer said.
“Democracy in Australia is too important to allow political parties to destroy our voting system.

“Since Australia’s federation in 1901 our democracy has allowed the people to choose who should represent them and we don't want politicians to be able to interfere with the ballots or tell us what voters are meant to do.

Mr Palmer said it is up to Australians to freely exercise their right to vote however they choose.
“Just because Nick Xenophon doesn’t like the outcome of an election, he does not have the right to change the system which has been responsible for the society and freedoms we now enjoy in Australia,” he said.

“Palmer United Party senators were elected in Queensland with more than 11 per cent of the vote and in Western Australia with 12.3 per cent of the primary vote.

“Mal Brough and Nick Xenophon’s attempts to rig the next election will fail the 30 per cent of Australians who don't vote for Liberal or Labor.

“This percentage of Australians deserves to have their voices heard and their choices must be left to them. If we destroy democracy in Australia, our society and our foundation as a nation will be undermined.”

Time for more Women in Cabinet: Clive Palmer

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says the Prime Minister has a great opportunity to bring intelligent women into cabinet.

Mr Palmer said former Howard government minister and Member for Murray Sharman Stone is an outstanding parliamentarian and should be considered by the Prime Minister for a cabinet position.

“The same can also be said of Member for Brisbane Teresa Gambaro, who understands the economy and what it takes to make a positive contribution to the community,” Mr Palmer said.

“Both of these women have suffered under the previous regime because of petty jealousy from other women, and Australia is poorer because of it.

“It is now time for Australia to unite together and do the right thing, and both Sharman Stone and Teresa Gambaro have what it takes to make a difference for the country.”

Plan to Bring Australia’s Sixth Undersea Communications Cable to Sunshine Coast Must Go Ahead: Clive Palmer

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said enhancing Australia’s connectivity to the online world was one his major policy platforms prior to the 2013 federal election.

Mr Palmer said his platform to bring Australia’s sixth undersea communications cable to the Sunshine Coast was opposed by the Liberal Party at the time.

“The Sunshine Coast Council’s proposal to bring the sixth undersea cable to the region makes sense from both security and connectivity perspectives,” Mr Palmer said.

“All political parties need to put aside their differences and unite to support this proposal.

“A cable into the Sunshine Coast would put the region at the forefront of internet access and provide Queensland with its own cable rather than relying on the connections to Sydney, which have been disrupted on numerous occasions.”

Mr Palmer said Queensland, and particularly the Sunshine Coast, now has an opportunity to become the next Silicon Valley if this proposal is introduced, as it will build on the existing education and university programs in the region.

“A cable into the Sunshine Coast will encourage new investment in technology-based enterprises as well as encourage global companies to make south-east Queensland their base in Australia,” he said. 

“This proposal will also add value to the Maroochydore City Centre project and enhance the capabilities of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital.

“It also renews the need for the federal government to look at increasing funding for the Sunshine Coast airport upgrade; with the infrastructure project not only offering thousands of jobs in the short term but also leading to sustainable employment opportunities in the tourism sector well into the future.”

We are concerned that under the FTA proposed that unqualified workers can come to Australia and work for a minimum wage and not meet Australian standards. We do not want to see any deaths result from unqualified work being done. This government and any government should have learnt from the tragedy that occurred during the ""Pink Batts"" debacle and put measures in place to stop this happening.

We also do not want to see Australian jobs and our standard of living decrease because foreign workers are coming here and undermining the wages and work for us here in Australia.

Palmer United are the only party who have a policy to keep all GST collected in WA, in WA. And with the government wanting to increase GST to 15%, that will mean over $5bn of money taken and spent in Sydney and Melbourne. Keeping this amount of money in WA, will mean more money for schools and hospitals and money to spend on infrastructure which in turn will create jobs.

The Liberal and Labor party voted together to send billions of dollars of GST collected in WA to Sydney and Melbourne. Now the government want to increase GST to 15% so they can send even more money from WA to eastern states.

The Liberals had released bogus Tasmanian polling results to fool Jacqui Lambie into supporting changes to Senate voting, according to federal leader of the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer.

Mr Palmer said consistent polling by the Palmer United Party in Tasmania contradicted the results released through the Liberal Party’s Victorian president Michael Kroger.

“The Tasmanian polling results being reported by the Liberals are just plain wrong,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“The Liberal Party would not release the real results from its polling at any time.

I made a speech about reform at the National Press Club and highlighted some of the key issues that should be changed.

Instead of focusing on trying to change the way people can vote, to secure their career political jobs for yet another term, politicians should be focused on making improvements to the way the AEC conduct election to eliminate chances of votes going missing, multiple voting and also the process which votes are counted. 

Scrutineers who observed the processes for our party in both Fairfax and WA senate counts raised concerns with interpretations of votes that could have had an impact on results.

As I have said we need to expand domestic demand and we can stimulate the economy by changing the way tax is paid by companies. Instead of paying tax in advance, based on an estimate of figures, we should allow companies to pay tax based on their actual figures at the end of the year after they have made the money. This way over $70bn will be released into the economy, and as the money circulates, it will create more jobs, real growth and indeed, more revenue for government. At the end of the year, the government will still receive the company tax that it is owed. At the current low interest rates I estimate it will cost about $800m in the first year, but this will be more than offset by the substantial increase in government revenue which is expected to be tens of billions.

This is just one change we can make that will help turbo charge the economy and provide more revenue for government which could then be spent on our schools, our hospitals and our pensioners.

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says the Government’s decision to introduce legislation to strip Australians of their citizenship if suspected of terrorism crimes is a breach of constitutional law.

Mr Palmer said under the proposed legislation, dual-nation citizens suspected of terrorism offences could lose their citizenship at the discretion of a Minister.

“To leave this decision solely in the hands of a minister is effectively breaching constitutional law. It means a citizen could be exiled without any sort of court hearing,” Mr Palmer said.

“If a citizen is suspected of terrorism offences, they should be able to appear in front of a court and prove their evidence.

“Under the proposed legislation, what should be a court decision made by a judge assessing the merits of a case, is a decision being made at the whim of a minister.

“Simply under this proposed legislation, a judicial review is proposed which does nothing to promote fairness and democracy. All a judicial review does is check that the decision maker has followed a correct process.

“The government is betraying Australian democracy and stripping Australians of individual freedom and protection.

“The courts should have a role in assessing the merits of a case, not just the minister.

“This is a fundamental right of all citizens and without it, fundamental rights would be lost thus violating international law without due process.

“Taking away citizenship without any reference to a court of law and leaving the decision up to a minister is an action that undermines fair judicial process.”",,

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, has congratulated the Government for adopting Palmer United Party policy on Australian food labelling.
The new labelling laws will force companies to show consumers what portion of a product is genuinely Australian.

Mr Palmer said the Palmer United Party promoted the idea prior to the last election as the Party believed urgent reform of Australian food labelling was required to keep profits in Australia and to protect local jobs.

“All consumers should have the right to make informed decisions about what they eat and how they are going to spend their money,” Mr Palmer said.

“A lot of products in the Australian market place contain misleading information.

“A product can be marked “Made in Australia” but contain no Australian grown ingredients.

“People may think they are supporting local Australian producers when in fact only a very small percentage of what they spend is staying in the country.

“The serious Hepatitis A outbreak that occurred earlier this year linked to imported frozen berries is an example of what can happen when consumers do not know what they are buying because of inadequate labelling laws.

“The Palmer United Party is committed to ensuring food labelling transparency to promote the endeavours of local producers and boost employment.

“We are very pleased that the government has decided to adopt food labelling reform and believe the action will promote and protect true Australian goods and services for the betterment of everybody in this country.”",,

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer says despite the government expressing its desire to assist small businesses in the 2015 budget, it was actually winding them up.

Mr Palmer said in May, 556 companies were in the process of being wound up by the government. 

“This figure represents 77 per cent of all wind-ups in Australia and is twice as many as July 2014, making the government the largest petitioner of bankruptcy in Australia,” Mr Palmer said.

“The government has dropped the threshold level for winding up businesses from $300,000 to $30,000. They are closing the doors of businesses before the business is given the opportunity to make money.”

“Is the government really supporting small business? 

“If the government was truly committed to helping small businesses they would adopt a Chapter 11-like system, similar to that of the United States.

“This would enable the equity of the business to be sold, but would allow the business to remain operational and continue to trade.

“This would not only help to save many struggling businesses but would also save jobs.”

Policing relies on trust and community support. In considering this bill I will set out for the House the true facts and circumstances of the Bali 9. 

We can only imagine how the father of one of the Bali 9 is feeling following his decision to do the right thing based on the legal advice of his barrister, to approach the Australian Federal Police and report breeches of section 541 of the Queensland criminal code and breeches of section 11.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code 1995.

In terms of S 541 of the Criminal Code (Qld), a conspiracy to commit a crime carries a term of imprisonment of seven years. 
Why then did the AFP fail to carry out its duty to arrest Scott Rush and instead allow him to leave Australian Jurisdiction knowing he was likely to face the death penalty in Indonesia? Why did the Indonesian authorities not allow the Bali 9 to be arrested in Australia? Australian Courts refuse to extradite a person to face the death penalty in a foreign land. Why should public servants and politicians not be held accountable to the same standard as Australian courts and Australian Justice? 

Passing this bill will hold them to that standard and protect and defend the lives of all Australians. The Government and Opposition must allow a free vote on this bill, Australians demand it. 

It seems to me that AFP officers committed a serious maleficence when they failed to carry out their duty and arrest the Bali 9 in Australia, when they knew they had committed a serious crime in Australia.

I seek leave of the house to table copies of the letters written by the AFP to the Indonesian National Police on 8th April 2005 and 12th April 2005 which, contrary to the information given in the course of the recent AFP media presentation, demonstrate that the AFP was aware, no later than 12th April 2005, of the identity of eight of the Bali 9.

Contrary to what was said in the course of the AFP press conference, they knew that the drug involved was heroin. They had detailed particulars of how the drug was to be carried and the part that was to be played, in the operation, by Chan.

Multiple Legal advice confirms the AFP had sufficient evidence to arrest Scott Rush on a charge of conspiracy prior to his leaving Australia. The AFP officers who failed to take such action should, in the circumstances, resign as officers of the AFP. They have destroyed the trust the Australian public had in the AFP to act honourably at all times, to put the life of Australians ahead of any other matter and uphold Australian Law in Australia.
 
The AFP didn’t act honourably when acting on information provided by Scott Rushes father. 

The AFP letter sought the cooperation of the Indonesian Authorities with a view to allowing all eight of the couriers to return to Australia, subjecting the identified eight to Australian law. 

Indonesian Law enforcement authorities had no regard for the AFPs plan and were more interested in arresting them in Indonesia. Was it a fight over promotions? One wonders how the AFP can trust the Indonesian authorities in the future.

It is almost inexplicable that the paragraph numbered 4 was included in the AFP letter. One would have thought it might even have been included in error. Of course, the AFP made it clear that it was not included by way of error. A deliberate decision was made to expose all eight to the death penalty.

It would appear that Deputy Commissioner Phelan was uneasy about the decision not to enforce Australian Law in Australia. It was made clear during the AFP press conference that there was one AFP officer who was not prepared to participate in the decision. That was certainly recognition of the fact the AFP was aware of the likely fate of the participants in the operation.
If the AFP were acting in accordance with the principles that Australians hold dear, they would not ever have deliberately exposed any Australian citizens to the death penalty. 

The assertions made by the AFP that they would act again as they did in 2005 would indicate that legislation is required to ensure the AFP firstly carries its duty, under Australian Law, and arrests people who have broken the Law in Australia and not allow them to leave Australia as they did on this occasion and secondly, to ensure the Law carries sanctions if they act contrary to Australia’s position, as they did in this case, and expose Australian Citizens to the death penalty.

Since 1973 and the passage of the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 (Cth), the death penalty has not applied in respect of offences under the law of the Commonwealth and Territories. Similar State legislation has outlawed the practice in the remaining Australian jurisdictions. 

On 11 March 2010, with bipartisan support, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Act. This Act amends the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 (Cth) to extend the current Commonwealth prohibition on the death penalty to all States and Territories. This forecloses the possibility of any individual State jurisdiction reintroducing the death penalty.

On 2 October 1990, Australia confirmed, at an international level, its opposition to the death penalty by ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty. The Protocol entered into force in international law on 11 July 1991.
More recently, on 19 December 2007, Australia sponsored and voted in favour of a landmark United Nations General Assembly resolution which called for an immediate moratorium on executions as a first step towards the universal abolition of the death penalty, more than half the General Assembly was prepared to vote in favour.

Faced with the prospect of the execution of some of our own citizens abroad, the Australian community has increasingly been forced to grapple with the question: what does it mean to be opposed to the death penalty in a region where our neighbours and allies continue to shoot and hang people?

Questions have been raised, for example, about the AFP Practical Guide on international police-to-police assistance in potential death penalty situations which allows the AFP to provided assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies in death penalty cases up until the point that a person is detained or charges are laid, and even beyond that point with Ministerial approval.

 Is it consistent with Australia's opposition to the death penalty to allow the AFP to work cooperatively with foreign law enforcement agencies in the investigation of offences which carry the death penalty - knowing that the provision of that assistance and information may ultimately lead to charge, conviction and eventually execution of an Australian citizen?

Questions have also been raised about whether the Mutual Assistance Act, should, as it currently does, allow the Attorney General a broad discretion to authorise the provision of mutual assistance in death penalty cases if he or she is satisfied that ""special circumstances"" exist. The term ""special circumstances"" is not defined in the Act.

Both sides of politics have provided an inconsistent and equivocal approach to the provision of agency-to-agency assistance in death penalty cases. In its current form, the new Guide perpetuates rather than remedies this anomaly. 

Only a Legislative approach will put the matter beyond question, Guidelines can change and Australians expect more.

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer says Australia’s most senior Catholic George Pell should return to Australia immediately to face victims of sexual abuse.

Mr Palmer said George Pell, who holds a senior position presiding over the Vatican’s finances, must accept responsibility and front the Royal Commission into child sexual abuse.

“Cardinal Pell must return to Australia and provide details of any information or knowledge of paedophilia in the Catholic priesthood,” he said. 

“His actions during his leadership tenure in Australia can best be described as negligent. He has failed those in his care.”
Mr Palmer said The Vatican must release all documents and knowledge in relation to the actions of the Catholic Church in Australia.

“It is time we moved away from niceties and dealt with the harsh reality that criminals within the church should be jailed and those who have allowed them to commit their crimes unpunished should also face the full weight of the law,’’ Mr Palmer said.
Mr Palmer also said it was time for the Catholic Church to consider abandoning its celibacy vow for priests.

“There is growing evidence that paedophilia in the church is linked to the vow of celibacy,’’ he said.

“The church has no greater responsibility than to protect its children.”

As well as being a risk for children, Mr Palmer said it also denied priests basic human rights.

“You cannot legally deprive a person the right to enter the priesthood because they refuse the vow of celibacy. Celibacy takes away from priests the human right to reproduce,’’ he said.",,

Small business tax cut 'will not be as effective' as Abbott government thinks 
By Gareth Hutchens

May 21, 2015, 7:22 p.m.
The tax cut for small businesses in the Abbott government's second budget will not be as effective as the government wants, economists have warned.

Tricks used to make bottom line look better
The tax cut for small businesses in the Abbott government's second budget will not be as effective as the government wants, economists have warned.

And the government is also likely to struggle with the 'fairness' question again this year, once all of the budget's numbers have been crunched.

The chief economist of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Saul Eslake, says the Abbott government's decision in its second budget to cut the company tax rate by 1.5 percentage points, from 30 per cent to 28.5 per cent, for small businesses with annual turnover of $2 million or less will not be as effective as it wants.

He says despite the popular belief that small businesses are big job creators and innovators, the tax cut is unlikely to have ""any material impact in stimulating stronger economic growth"" because a smaller proportion of companies than expected will benefit from it.

""Almost 63 per cent of small companies will derive no benefit from [the 1.5 percentage point tax cut] because they are neither profitable nor taxable,"" Mr Eslake has written in a note to clients.
""And for those companies which do derive some benefit from it, the benefit is in most cases likely to be too small to induce them to do something which they would not do otherwise,"" such as hiring more people or increasing capital expenditure, he said.

Bureau of Statistics data show there are 2,100,162 actively trading businesses in Australia, and over 1,964,000 (or 93.6 per cent) of them had a turnover of $2 million or less in the 2013/14 financial year.

To take advantage of the Abbott government's tax cut, such businesses have to be profitable and taxable.

But Australian Tax Office data show only 37 per cent of incorporated businesses with a turnover of $2 million or less met that criteria in 2012/13.

Ben Phillips, the principal research fellow at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, has warned that the Abbott government's second budget will also likely face questions of unfairness again.

Speaking in Canberra on Thursday, Mr Phillips said the centre's analysis of last year's budget showed low-income families with children received a financial hit of around $2000 to $4000, ""and [for] high-income families there was effectively no hit at all,"" he said.

Mr Phillips says the families package and age pension package in the government's second budget may not redress the unfairness issue from last year.

""In terms of a day-after impact, I suspect you'll still find that the general unfairness is there,"" Mr Phillips said.

""Middle-income families, some low-income families will certainly benefit, but overall I would expect that the fairness/unfairness issue perhaps still remains, but not all of those numbers have been crunched, so we'll have to wait and see.""

His speech picked apart the budget, just as he did last year when he dismantled the debt myth peddled by the government, forcing them to eventually admit the economy was in much better shape than they would have the Australian public believe.

2015's budget response is full of real and current data showing us the real state of Australia's economic affairs. It's also rich on ideas on how to reinstate Australia as the 'lucky country' once again.

Palmer United Party federal leader and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, was mobbed by excited students who were keen to take a selfie with the Queensland politician at Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s old school today. 

Mr Palmer was invited to address students at Saint Ignatius’ College, Riverview, during a lunch time “Hot Potato” workshop. Many students were locked out of the auditorium after it quickly filled to capacity, while students inside responded with roaring cheers and a standing ovation when Mr Palmer took to the podium.

Mr Palmer said he was thrilled to have been invited to speak at Saint Ignatius’ College and was overwhelmed by the response from the students.

“It took me more than 15 minutes to leave the auditorium after the workshop as students demanded selfies and autographs,” Mr Palmer said.

“It was great to be able to meet and connect with them and discuss what Australia’s future should be, after all these are the minds of Australia’s future.

“I doubt Tony Abbott would have been as popular with the students as I was.”

During the workshop Mr Palmer said all Australians, including the 20 per cent that failed to vote at the 2013 election, should execute their right to vote when the Liberal government call a double dissolution within the next eight weeks.",,Clive Palmer added 2 new photos.

Instead of barking on about Johnny Depp’s dogs, Barnaby Joyce should be concentrating on the important issue of helping Australia’s battling farmers, according to federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer.

Mr Palmer said the Agriculture Minister was making Australia an international laughing stock with his campaign against the movie star’s pets Pistol and Boo.

“The simple solution would be to put the dogs into quarantine today, rather than threaten to kill them,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“This is nothing but an embarrassing act of grandstanding by Barnaby Joyce which will result in a bad reputation for Australia and hurt the struggling film industry on the Gold Coast.

“Barnaby should do something about drought relief rather than involve himself in this sideshow.

“His actions could potentially put the movie project in jeopardy and damage our relationship with the US, costing thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in exports,’’ Mr Palmer said.",,

Clive Palmer has criticised Glenn Lazarus’s decision to establish his own political party, saying the Palmer United Party defector had no idea about teamwork.

“Glenn Lazarus does not know what it is like to be on a proper team,’’ said the Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax. 

“He deserted the Palmer United Party, betraying all those who voted for our party and our many members who worked so hard to get their representative elected in Queensland,’’ he said.

Mr Palmer said he and Western Australian Senator Dio Wang were part of a team with Glenn Lazarus and were still together.

“Glenn Lazarus will be solitary figure who plays solitaire in his office all day long,’’ Mr Palmer said.

Mr Palmer said the Glenn Lazarus Team was being set up for the sole purpose of securing an income for his wife, Tess Lazarus.

“Team Lazarus will follow a tradition of sports related failures in politics like Mel Meninga and The Australian Sports Party in WA, which got less than 1% of the vote,’’ Mr Palmer said.
“What I and many Australians find most disappointing is a politician saying one thing before an election and then doing something entirely different once elected.
“Glenn Lazarus received only 6000 votes at the last election while the Palmer United Party received in excess of 250,000.  He then deserts the team and the constituents who voted for it when it got too hot on the field.

“He chose self-interests and now chooses to have his own party using public funding,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Too many politicians have their snout in the trough.” 
Mr Palmer said Mr Lazarus was still to repay the $6 million that Palmer United spent on him being elected.

“Glenn Lazarus knows what was in the Party’s constitution and his obligations to the Party. He has showed himself to be unreliable and speaking with a forked tongue. 

“The Australian public should be warned that Team Lazarus won’t help Australians but is designed to help the Lazarus family only,’’ Mr Palmer said.",,

Mr Palmer said it was disgusting to see such blatant misrepresentation of material.

“Paul Murray replayed footage of me sitting alone at a table in the empty Ballroom of the Hyatt Hotel in Canberra and claimed that no one showed up to the Palmer United Party’s budget response luncheon,” Mr Palmer said.

“This was a blatant misrepresentation designed to deceive and concocted from lies.”

Mr Palmer said in actual fact the Ballroom was filled to capacity with party members, invited guests, media and high profile attendees all joining Mr Palmer for the lunch.

“Almost 200 guests including Palmer United Party Senator Dio Wang and fellow crossbench senators Bob Day and David Leyonhjelm attended the lunch to listen to my response to the 2015 federal budget,” he said.

“Union officials including Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) president Ged Kearney and Community and Public Sector Union national secretary Nadine Flood also attended the lunch as well as Council of Small Business of Australia chief executive Peter Strong.

“For Paul Murray to say that ‘no one turned up’ and claim that not even Senator Dio Wang, is nothing but a blatant lie.

The Palmer United Party announced today it would no longer contest state elections in order to concentrate on achieving more for Australians at the federal level. 

National director Peter Burke has confirmed that the Palmer United Party would contest all seats at the next federal election and move its focus away from state elections. 

“The party executive has decided, in consultation with our many thousands of members, that the federal platform is where we can achieve more for Australians moving forward,’’ Mr Burke said.

“We believe Federal parliament is where the Palmer United Party can make the most valuable contribution so that is where we will be focussing our attention in the future.

Mr Palmer said the asset test for the pension had taken the burden off government for many years and now was the time to be fair to all Australians.

“When interest rates are at record lows meaning many self-funded retirees will now need support, it is unfair to change the criteria and have them suffer.

Executions of Australians Overseas

The Foreign Death Penalty Offences (Preventing Information Disclosure) Bill 2015

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, has introduced a private member’s bill to help prevent the future executions of Australian citizens
in foreign countries.

Co-sponsored by independent Federal Member for Indi, Cathy McGowan, the bill follows the tragic execution of Bali Nine pair Myuran Sukumaran, 33, and Andrew Chan, 31, in
Indonesia.

The Foreign Death Penalty Offences (Preventing Information Disclosure) Bill 2015 proposed by Mr Palmer is a Bill for an Act to prevent the disclosure of information by public officials in circumstances that may lead to the imposition of the death penalty in foreign countries.

Mr Palmer is urging Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, to allow a conscience vote on the matter.

Mr Palmer said the member’s bill addresses the issues of Australian authorities cooperating with international law enforcement agencies when it meant the death penalty could be
imposed on Australian citizens overseas.

“If the Australian Federal Police are aware of Australians involved in a capital punishment crime committed in a foreign country, then they should not be allowed to provide information which could expedite the death penalty,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“In the very saddening case of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, if these two Australian citizens were arrested on their return to Australia, their lives would be saved.

“There needs to be an urgent review of policies that could expose Australians to the death penalty. The death penalty is barbaric and solves nothing.”

“This private member’s bill to restrict co-operation between Australian and international authorities when the outcome involves capital punishment offences for our citizens,’’ Mr
Palmer said.

Mr Palmer said the Palmer United Party successfully negotiated with the Abbott Government to retain the Climate Change Authority as well as the enquiry into major environmental initiatives by Bernie Fraser, chairman of the Climate Change Authority.

The report has urged Australia to fast-track its cuts to greenhouse gases, declaring the country is falling short of the task required to cut emissions by 2020 if we want to match the efforts of other countries in the effort to curb global warming.

“This report puts the pressure on the Abbott Government and the Labor Party to take serious steps against global warming by lifting their ambition on ETS targets,” Mr Palmer said.

“This report is yet another example of the Palmer United Party delivering real results for everyday Australians through a common-sense approach.”

Mr Palmer said it was his meeting with former United States Vice-President Al Gore last year that convinced him of the need for the whole world to work together and that Australia needed to establish a new ETS.

“The Palmer United Party’s proposed ETS would only become effective once Australia’s main trading partners also took action to establish one,” he said.

“The scheme will have a zero carbon price and the government will eventually have the ability to set the financial parameters of the scheme depending on the actions of Australia’s leading trading partners such as China, the United States, the European Union, Japan and Korea.

“In understanding climate change, we must remain ever vigilant and be aware of how Australia as part of the international community is doing and, more importantly, what the global community can do together to make the lives of all those who inhabit the world more secure.”",,

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, has renewed his calls for a National Economic Summit, fearing Tony Abbott is following the Newman Government’s failed model that led to chronic unemployment in Queensland.

Mr Palmer said Queensland had the dubious honour of having one of the nation’s worst unemployment rates at around 6.6%, due to Campbell Newman’s terrible economic legacy.

“This is not a template for the Abbott Government to follow,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“We need to stimulate the economy to get Australia moving again and the first step should be to have a National Economic Summit. I have called for this previously and I note that even Rupert Murdoch has echoed my thoughts,’’ Mr Palmer said.
 
“Politics must be put to one side and we should come together as a nation to find the best ways to restore business confidence in Australia.
 
“We need Australia’s top business minds, politicians and academics to come together and outline a plan to return to the standards of living Australians deserve,’’ Mr Palmer said.
 
Mr Palmer said the Abbott Government needed to listen to a wide range of views from business and other community leaders to help drive the national economy forward.

“The Prime Minister and the Cabinet spend too much time getting advice from Treasury officials on economic matters,” he said.

“These people all look the same, talk the same and read from the same book and they are just trying to protect their own jobs. They have no experience in the wider world of business.

“Yet these people are the drivers of our economic prosperity. This needs to change.”

Mr Palmer said an economic summit would generate ideas to get the country moving again.

“All we hear from the Government at the moment is plans for new taxes or spending cuts, we need to stimulate the economy like they have done in the US and create jobs,” he said.",,

Federal Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, is delighted to confirm that Commonwealth funding has been secured for the Airmen Aircrew Association under the Saluting Their Service Commemorations Programme.

The Saluting Their Service Commemorations programme aims to honour the sacrifice and service of Australia’s servicemen and women in wars, conflicts and peace operations, and to promote appreciation of the role those who have served played in shaping the nation.

The Airmen Aircrew Association have received funding of $2,750 to purchase an Airmen Aircrew Association banner to commemorate 100 years of military aviation service.

Mr Palmer said he was very pleased that funding had been allocated to such an important community organisation as the Airmen Aircrew Association.

“It’s vital we preserve our wartime heritage and history through projects and programmes such as Saluting Their Service,” Mr Palmer said.

“These grants allow not-for-profit organisations to build or maintain programs, commemorate important moments in history and provide a space for veterans to socialise, reconnect with long-lost friends as well as offer support in times of need.”",,

National director of the Palmer United Party Peter Burke said claims made by Glenn Lazarus in Fairfax media over the weekend were untrue and designed to damage the party.
 
“At no time did the Palmer United Party consider a proposal for its senators to join the Liberal Party, or any other party,’’ Mr Burke said.
 
“The Palmer United Party is governed by a constitution and does not have the authority to do so. The party would never desert the Australians who voted for it or its party members.”
 
“Never has the Palmer United Party had discussions with the Liberal Party about a merger.
 
“If there was any truth in what Senator Lazarus is saying, why would he wait three months to raise these allegations?
 
“His comments are highly defamatory to the Palmer United Party and our leader and have been designed to cause damage.
 
“We will be undertaking defamation proceedings against Senator Lazarus over this matter,” Mr Burke said.
 
Mr Burke said the future of the Palmer United Party is very bright. It has called for nominations for all House of Representative and Senate seats at the next federal election and received hundreds of nominations.
 
“The reason Senator Lazarus makes these accusations is because his wife Tess was sacked by the party.
 
“There is no doubting the timing of Senator Lazarus’s defection from the party which came after Tess’s sacking as a result of her not doing her job.”
 
Mr Burke said Tess Lazarus was dismissed for spending her time writing speeches and questions for her husband instead of working on agreed party duties.
 
“After repeated efforts to have her engage in the correct party duties were ignored, the party had no alternative but to dismiss her,’’ Mr Burke said.
 
Mr Burke said the Palmer United Party received more than 250,000 votes above the line at the last Federal Senate election and only 6770 votes went below the line to Glenn Lazarus, showing that voters clearly had put the party before any individual.
 
“Senator Lazarus remains bitter but he is the one who betrayed all those who voted for the Palmer United Party and the party’s members who worked so hard to have their representative elected in Queensland.
 
“Australians are sick of politicians telling them one thing before an election and then behaving differently once elected.
 
“Our constitution requires any party representative who resigns from the party to refund money spent on their campaign which, so far, Senator Lazarus has failed to do.
“We have written to Senator Lazarus demanding reimbursement of funds spent on his campaign but he seems to be obfuscating responsibility.
 
“His actions have been defamatory. I would expect more from a great Australian sportsman. I think the way he is acting puts him off-side with the rugby league community,’’ Mr Burke said.",,

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says he is heartened by the release of all children from the Christmas Island detention centre following his party’s actions in creating major Migration Act concessions for asylum seekers.
 
Mr Palmer said the release of children from detention at Christmas Island was a win for the Palmer United Party, asylum seeker families and Australia as a whole.
 
He said the party wanted to see all children released, no matter where they are detained, as a matter of urgency.
 
“The Palmer United Party has been a staunch advocator for human rights particularly on the matters of asylum seeker policy and children in detention,’’ Mr Palmer said.
“We are very pleased to have played a key role in securing the release of children on Christmas Island by passing an amended Migration Act in the senate which led to the creation of Safe Haven Enterprise Visas allowing work and study rights for refugees, among other measures.
 
Mr Palmer said he had received several assurances from the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, after contacting him concerning allegations raised in Australian Human Rights Commission’s (AHRC) Forgotten Children report.
 
By late 2014 all children and families had been transferred from Christmas Island to the mainland and as at March this year there were 118 children held in detention according to Mr Dutton.
 
“The Government must do everything in its power to reduce this number to zero as soon as possible whilst protecting all detained children from abuse and ensuring all incidents are properly referred to relevant authorities,’’ Mr Palmer said.
 
Mr Palmer has welcomed the Department of Immigration’s request for an audit into all reportable incidents going back to 2008 and the establishment of a panel of eminent persons to examine the management of incidents involving children in detention.
 
Mr Palmer said he had always believed it was wrong to keep children behind bars.

“Whether they took this dangerous voyage with their parents or were born in detention, every child deserves a safe and loving upbringing with a range of experiences, not just the inside of a cell or an exercise yard,” he said.

Key achievements by the Palmer United Party on asylum seeker policy children include:

·        Re-establishing Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs);
·        Creating the new Safe Haven Enterprise Visa (SHEV), which is available for up to 5 years to those found to be refugees, and:
- allows them work and study rights,
- requires them to live and work in designated regions to fill regional job vacancies,
- allows them to apply for other on-shore visas such as family, skilled and student visas, after 3.5 years of not accessing welfare, and
- would not be subject to a capping of numbers by the Minister.
·        Ensuring that Australia's refugee intake will increase by 7,500 places;
·        Ensuring  that asylum seekers currently in Australia on bridging visas gain the right to work until their claims to refugee status are processed.",,

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said Senator Jacqui Lambie’s referral to the Clerk of the Senate has no foundations.

Mr Palmer said the legal action is a civil matter and relates to the recovery of party funds based on what happened prior to the last federal election.

He said the action is based on a promise and the party spending millions of dollars relying on those promises made by Senator Lambie.

“Senator Lambie has breached promises and that doesn’t release her from accountability under the law,” Mr Palmer said.

“Regardless of who they are, no Member of Parliament is above the Australian law.

“The Palmer United Party hasn’t made any threats with its correspondence or public statements, the party is simply seeking a refund of the dollars spent on Senator Lambie’s election campaign.”

Mr Palmer said no one should expect special treatment or think they are above the law.

“The Palmer United Party simply hopes Senator Lambie will refund the dollars spent in reliance of her promises and legal action will not be necessary,” he said.

“The party’s legal action does not seek to interfere with Senator Lambie’s performance, remove her from her seat or interfere with her Senate vote in any way.

“This cause of action has nothing to do with the Senate but the legal obligation under Australian law to recoup the money spent on her reliance of promises made.”",,

Former Palmer United Senators Glenn Lazarus and Jacqui Lambie are facing legal action for breaking promises to voters and the party, national director Peter Burke announced today.

“What we have witnessed with Glenn Lazarus and Jacqui Lambie is misleading and deceptive,’’ Mr Burke said.

“It is our view that Ms Lambie and Mr Lazarus have betrayed all those who voted for the Palmer United Party and the party’s members who worked so hard to get their representative elected in Tasmania and Queensland,’’ he said.

Mr Burke was commenting on recent developments which have seen former Palmer United Party Senators Lazarus and Lambie defect the party to become independents with the latter this week announcing the formation of her own political party.

“Australians are tired of politicians saying one thing before an election and then breaking their promises afterwards.

Mr Lazarus and Ms Lambie have badly let down the party and all the voters in their respective states who trusted them to do what they said they would do.

“The Palmer United Party relied on Glenn Lazarus’ and Jacqui  Lambie’s promise when they sought endorsement to represent the party at the 2013 Senate election, that if elected they would represent Palmer United in the Senate for their six-year term.

“Relying on those promises, the party spent millions of dollars and thousands of party supporters worked hard to get Mr Lazarus and Ms Lambie elected.

“They have now broken their promises and the party will seek to recover in the courts, under the principle of promissory estoppel, those party funds,’’ he said.

“Both have shown themselves to be opportunists seeking to use the party resources for themselves deceptively. They have acted unreliably and have proven to be untrustworthy.”

Mr Burke said the executive committee of the party had already allocated $3 million to cover legal costs.

“It is anticipated the party’s claim against Mr Lazarus will be in the order of $7 million, equivalent to the amount the party spent in Queensland, and more than $2 million for what was spent getting Ms Lambie elected in Tasmania.”

The return lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission shows the party spent over $26 million across Australia at the last election.

“We believe that Glenn Lazarus and Jacqui Lambie must pay to the party the money it spent in reliance of a promise that they both broke.

“Party legal advice confirms the strength of the party position under law,’’ he said.

“We have also consulted extensively with our members over these matters, who feel very disillusioned.”

In Queensland, the Palmer United Party received more than 250,000 votes above the line at the last Federal Senate election and only 6770 votes went below the line to Glenn Lazarus. In Tasmania the figures were 20,293 votes above the line to Palmer United and just 1501 below the line to Jacqui Lambie.

“Clearly, in both states, voters put the Palmer United Party before the individual candidates and we do not believe either of them held their seats on their own merits,’’ Mr Burke said.",,

25 March 2015

Before the last election Malcolm Fraser and I had lunch in Melbourne. When I met him on that cold Melbourne morning he was in high spirits, eager to engage in debate about important issues affecting Australia’s future. 

High on his mind that morning and over lunch was the threat to the world, and Australia, of war. He stated that the world had been at war for over 50 years in different parts of the globe and he wondered when it would all stop.

He was a strong supporter of the development and sustainable growth and said as Prime Minister: “Development requires modification and transformation of the environment. The planet’s capacity to support its people is irreversibly reduced by the destruction and degradation of the biosphere and the need to understand the problem and take corrective action is becoming urgent.”

He saw the dangers to our planet far before others had thought about the issue. In his travels around Australia as prime minister he touched the people and they touched him. He valued our democracy and reminded us in 1980 as our Prime Minister that “Secrecy is completely inadequate for democracy but totally appropriate for Tyranny.”

As Malcolm Fraser once said when referring to Nelson Mandela,
“If there were six Nelson Mandela’s around today, a couple in Europe, one in America and in a couple of other places, there wouldn’t be any wars.

“The truth is today that if there was six Malcolm Frasers around today, a couple in Europe, one in America and in a couple of other places, there wouldn’t be any wars.”

Like many world leaders he helped Nelson Mandela on his long walk to freedom.

He supported the South African people in their struggle for human rights and self-determination.

No greater accolade can be given to any man no greater title or acknowledgement than that of peacemaker.

Malcolm Fraser believed in the reconciliation of man. He sought refuge for the stateless. He saw injustice and he tried to stop it. He saw division in this country and he tried to heal it. He devoted his life to those less fortunate than himself.

Gifted in intelligence, he perceived and saw what others could not see.

He saw an Australia where all Australian children could join hands and take that long walk together into the future. 
He saw an Australia where all cultures of the world could be united in one country valuing their heritage and embracing each other in one nation.

His words in 1981 during his inaugural address to the Institute of Multicultural Affairs in 1981 are equally true today.

“Multiculturalism speaks to us forcefully and directly; it is not an abstract or alien notion, not a blueprint holding out utopian promises, but a set of guidelines for action which grows directly out of our society, aspirations and experiences.”

While understated and modest in his manner, he was strong on courage and commitment. One of the rarest commodities in political life is courage. Political courage, the ability to do what is right regardless of the cost, regardless of admonishment to go forward where others would not go.

He showed us the way and we must follow his example and cherish the gifts he has left for us as citizens of this great country.  

I remember back in the early 80s when no state was interested in hosting Expo 88.

It was Malcolm Fraser who had the persistence to stay with it to go the course to continue to fight for the Expo to be held in Australia and the then Queensland Premier Sir Joh agreed with the Prime Minister to hold it in Queensland. Without Malcolm Fraser’s persistence the people of Brisbane would not have Brisbane’s South Bank today and Australians would not have enjoyed Expo 88.
I remember another time when Sir Joh’s staff flew back to Queensland after a Premiers’ Conference and left the Queensland Premier sleeping in the Lakeside hotel. They got to the Queensland border when they remembered they had left the Premier in Canberra. 

They contacted the Prime Minister’s Office who never hesitated in offering the Queensland Premier the hospitality of The Lodge.

As Sir Joh told me he arrived at The Lodge and the Prime Minister even offered him a pair of his pyjamas. Malcolm Fraser was quite a bit taller than Sir Joh and Sir Joh said that as he walked around he had to hold up his pyjama pants so they would not fall off and his feet only went down to where Malcolm’s knees were. 

During the night Sir Joh went to the kitchen to get a drink, opened the fridge and a light came on, at which time security challenged him and he held up his arms and he remarked to me that security got quite a surprise.

Sir Joh remarked to me there was not many people that would give their own pyjamas but Malcolm Fraser would.
For Malcolm Fraser ‘life wasn’t meant to be easy’.

But for Malcolm Fraser it could have been. He chose his own way freely. He chose a life of service. He chose the hard way; the more difficult road.

He should not become greater at this time than he was in life. An Australian who was prepared to give all for the service of his country and to weather the storm no matter how difficult, no matter how hard, without complaint.

His integrity was beyond question as he said himself, ‘Flexibility in pursuit of the nation’s interests must never be allowed to degenerate into expediency.’

His humility moved those who came to know him in life. He believed in our people and all the people of the region and the world

He brought peace and fought for those who suffered under the yoke of racism. 

In my discussion with him it was clear he had a pure mind, but more importantly he had a pure heart. I extend my sincere condolences to his family. The world is so much better because of Malcolm Fraser; a citizen of the world who cared. 

As it has been said, he will stand to those of us who are left as an incarnation of the spirit of the land he loved.

One of those with whom I discussed Malcolm Fraser in the last couple of days said he was a big man with his six-foot-plus frame. For people who had never met him before he was a big man, bigger than many realised. 

All of our lives are enriched for having lived on this earth in the time of Malcolm Fraser.

The Abbott Government has reversed its position on Australia’s debt problem in the face of overwhelming evidence presented by the Palmer United Party that our economy is one of the strongest in the world.

After prolonged fearmongering over a so-called debt emergency, Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey have made a stunning about face on the state of the Australian economy saying debt levels were now manageable.

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said the Australian Government’s admission that there was no debt problem was a significant win for the Palmer United Party.

“Since entering parliament I have been campaigning that we don’t have a debt problem and we should be growing and expanding our economy,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Finally the government is admitting the truth about debt and yet its policy settings do not reflect what they are saying by pushing ahead with major budget cuts that will hurt all Australians.

“Joe Hockey still has his head stuck in the sand by insisting on these tough budgetary measures which will only impede growth and see any hope of achieving a surplus drift further away.”

Mr Palmer said the Abbott Government needed to stimulate and expand the Australian economy rather than implement policies based on the false impression that our debt level was too high.

Clive Palmer

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, today called on the Abbott Government to establish Australia as a foundation member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

Mr Palmer said Australia’s future was tied to Asia and participating in the international financial institution would be crucial to the nation’s economic development.

“We need to cooperatively engage with Asian countries such as China, Japan and Korea,’’ Mr Palmer said.
He said Australia had already debated the concept, previously championed by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in 1999, calling for the establishment of an Asian monetary fund for the purpose of enterprise and growth in a multicultural region.

“We have seen the Obama administration engage with the AIIB and this is a great sign for all countries in the world of the importance of peace and cooperation Mr Palmer said.

“Investment in infrastructure with all Asia Pacific countries is crucial for our region.

“Japan, Korea, China and Australia must work co-operatively. The Pacific Ocean doesn’t separate Asia and the US and other nations but joins all countries as a lake of peace where co-operation is key.

“As Chinese Foreign Minister Wang said, it’s an Asian infrastructure investment bank and Japan is an important part of Asia, we can cooperate together.”

“Australians should never forget the words of Winston Churchill – to jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war.

“2015 marks 70 years since World War II, we can’t change history but we can acknowledge it and use it to guide us to a better future.”

Mr Palmer said Australia needed to play a pivotal role as a foundation member in the AIIB as it was fundamental to the country’s future.

“By being a part of the AIIB Australia can assure good governance, environment and social safeguards,” Mr Palmer said.

“This is an opportunity for a win-win for all countries and citizens and we must reach out and unite with our Asian neighbours.”",,

BRISBANE: The Palmer United Party can confirm today that discussions with the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) have commenced in relation to joining the DLP in a high court action over the recent resignations of Senators Glenn Lazarus (PUP) and John Madigan (DLP).

Australians have had enough of politicians saying one thing before an election and then acting differently once voted in.

Mr Lazarus said prior to the last federal election that he would be part of Palmer United and lead our team. We believe he has misled the party.

It is for this reason we are considering joining the Democratic Labour Party’s high court challenge which it has launched against Senator John Madigan in a bid to have him evicted from the Australian Parliament.

Mr Palmer said the government started out not supporting the automotive industry which has caused manufacturers to commit to exiting the country and jeopardising Australian exports.

“Tony Abbott essentially gave a mandate to the major automotive companies to leave the country and abandon their investments in Australia,” Mr Palmer said.

“Now the government’s decision to abandon the $500 million cut to the automotive industry is too little too late.

“This backflip from Tony Abbott and his government comes after the industry has already committed to leaving the country at the end of 2017.”

Mr Palmer said this is a shallow promise and does not achieve anything for the automotive industry, Australia’s exports or our economy,” he said.

“Government’s need to be consistent and backflips such as these are nothing but an attempt to right their wrongs when things got too hot in the kitchen.

“Unfortunately when it comes to the automotive industry, this backflip comes too little too late.”",,

The Palmer United Party has been saddened to hear of the passing of the party’s inaugural life member and 2013 federal candidate for Wentworth, Marsha Foxman.

Federal Leader on the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer, said Marsha lost her long battle with cancer late last week and his thoughts are with her husband, daughter and their family and friends.

“Marsha Foxman made a huge contribution to her community and was a much loved member of the Palmer United Party,” Mr Palmer said.

“She was an exceptional woman who was passionate about serving her local region and the broader community, her outstanding service and willingness to lead by example will be missed by many.

“Marsha worked selflessly and tirelessly, most notably in the area of fair trading, to make both her community and her country a better place for all to share.

“Her dedication, selflessness, passion and hard work set the standards for others to follow. Without people like Marsha Foxman, Australia would not be the country it is.” 

Born and bred in the Sydney suburb of Bondi Beach, Marsha Foxman has written a book on political reform and her submissions to government standing committees have resulted in amendments to banking practices.

A highly committed member, Marsha was one of the first to join the Palmer United Party when it was formed just prior to the 2013 federal election. She since encouraged dozens more to join the party ranks.

Marsha fearlessly went head to head with Liberal heavyweight Malcolm Turnbull, contesting the 2013 federal election in the seat of Wentworth.

Her commitment to the party is such that she proudly attended the maiden speech in parliament of Federal Leader Clive Palmer.

The Palmer United Party announced in February that Marsha Foxman was a deserving recipient of the party’s inaugural life membership award.",,

Making a Difference
 
In my maiden speech to Parliament, I pointed out the main thing in serving the community was the battle of ideas.
 
The number of seats or individual interests is not the most important thing in politics.
 
Establishing the party six weeks before the last election was a difficult process, requiring the endorsement over 200 candidates in a short time.
 
The party endorsement processes were not developed as well as they are now and unfortunately many of the candidates were opportunists interested in themselves more than the ideas the party represented.
 
Given the position the party took in the Senate, there has been a constant barrage from major parties to undermine Palmer United’s position.
 
The Palmer United Party has achieved a lot for Australia. We have shown that ideas can make a difference and millions of Australians are better off today because of the party’s determination to protect them.
 
Palmer United has set up three parliamentary committees, reduced electricity prices by 10%, saved the Clean Energy Corporation, saved the Climate Change Authority and ARENA, saved low income super, abolished the mining tax, saved the RET, stopped the Medicare co-payment and opposed reforms which would have denied Australians access to higher education.
 
All the major party politicians and senators who have sought to undermine our party would never have left their party because they have the political experience to know that only within a party structure can real change be achieved for Australia.
 
I am confident at the next election our team will be stronger, tougher and more importantly, committed to what we stand for without the individuals mainly concerned with themselves and what they can get.
 
Today Palmer United has more members than ever, is better organised and is in a stronger position than we were before the last federal election.
 
The reality is that Australians who vote for Palmer United will determine who the next government of Australia will be.",,

Resignation of Senator Lazarus

It is disappointing for the thousands of members of the Palmer United Party that individuals have put their personal interests ahead of party priorities and what can be achieved for Australia.

Regardless of the individual demands within the party, the Palmer United Party will stay true to its beliefs.

Early yesterday afternoon, I forwarded a letter to Tess Lazarus terminating her employment from the party.

This was done primarily because she failed to comply with the terms of her employment.

Senator Lazarus’ resignation followed thereafter, with the reason being self-evident.

I note from his statement his reasons were not related to political matters or to the duty he had to promote the party policy and to support its platform, its membership and the thousands of Queenslanders who trusted him to stay strong to these values having elected him to the Senate. 

The party made the correct decision in terminating Tess Lazarus’ employment. It is disappointing that politicians put their personal interests above those who elect them.",,

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, has blasted the Intergenerational Report as a ‘Liberal Party publication’ instead of the honest economic assessment Australians deserved to hear.

Mr Palmer said the Intergenerational Report blatantly ignored the Government’s own data and continued to push lies told to the electorate by the Prime Minister.

“It should have been a Liberal Party publication, it is misleading and deceptive,’’ Mr Palmer said.

Mr Palmer said the report released by Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey today ignored the Australian Trade Commission’s Why Australia Benchmark Report 2015, which painted a picture of optimism and economic strength for Australia.

“The Why Australia report shows that since 1991, Australia is the leading country for growth in the world’s developed economies,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“It also points to Australia being a leader in gains of labour productivity and having a GDP growing at a faster rate than most western economies.”  

Other elements of the Why Australia report which the Intergenerational Report failed to consider are Australia being the number one country in the world for tertiary enrolments and having the highest secondary school enrolments in the world.

“Education is not only a good social policy but a good economic policy,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Government shouldn’t lie about debt. With interest rates being so low it is actually a good time to borrow, invest in more infrastructure and stimulate the economy. 

“Remember our debt is one of the lowest in the world.

“Now is a time the Government should be investing in the country and our people otherwise the Government and the Prime Minister risk political suicide. All we are seeing is reduced business confidence and pain being inflicted on Australians as a result of uncertainty.”

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says the Australian Hepatitis A outbreak linked to a brand of imported frozen berries could have been avoided with better food labelling.

Mr Palmer has re-iterated his call for urgent reform of Australian food labelling to safeguard consumers, keep profits at home and protect local jobs.

“The serious Hepatitis A outbreak linked to these imported frozen berries is an example of what can happen when consumers do not know what they are buying because of inadequate labelling laws,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“People deserve the opportunity to be able to make informed decisions about what they eat and how they are going to spend their money.”

Mr Palmer said the Palmer United Party is committed to ensuring uniform food-labelling reform in Australia to promote the endeavours of local producers, boost employment and keep consumers better informed.

“Under the current laws, it is impossible to determine the breakdown between ingredients and packaging when an item is labelled Australian-made,” Mr Palmer said.

“People may think they are supporting Australian producers when in fact only a very small percentage of what they spend may be staying in the country.”

He said clarity in labelling on all packaging remains one of the priorities of the Palmer United Party.

“We want to introduce a coloured tag system to properly inform consumers of the origins of the products they buy,” he said.

“If a product contains more than five percent of the product including packaging not originating in Australia, it would carry a red tag and if an item has 95% or more of its content made in Australia then we would be proposing a green and gold tag.

“The aim of this kind of food labelling reform would enable consumers to be able to make informed decisions about their purchases and to promote and protect truly Australian goods and services for the betterment of everybody in this country.”",,

“The government should be doing all that they can to promote Australia’s growth and instead all they plan on doing is introduce new taxes or spending cuts,” he said.

“A National Economic Summit would enable both sides of politics, business and community leaders and economists to generate ideas to stimulate the Australian economy and drive it forward into the future.

The LNP is ready to offload state-owned power networks and other Queensland government assets to Chinese interests, says the federal leader of the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer.
 
Mr Palmer said the “real” plans for privatisation emerged when it was reported today a Chinese Government owned entity had appointed a major bank to act for the company to buy $50 billion worth of assets the Queensland and NSW Governments want to sell.
 
“Our assets will still be owned by government but it won't be our government – it will be the Chinese government,” Mr Palmer said.
 
“Do we really want to transfer from the Queensland Government our hospitals and schools?  Campbell Newman and his LNP government are traitors to the people of Queensland. We don't want the Chinese Government deciding how Queenslanders live and what they pay for their electricity in their own state.”
 
Mr Palmer said the Newman Government’s plan to lease state assets on 99-year contracts is ludicrous as no one will be here to see those assets when they are returned.
 
“Our hospitals, ports, schools and power companies are all in the firing line of a government that believes the only way to solve Queensland’s debt problem is to offload major state-owned assets and cut expenditure,” he said.

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s cabinet reshuffle won’t have any effect unless the government changes its policy.

Mr Palmer said reshuffling the pack of cards does not mean a new deal.

“Australians need policy that puts the needs of their families before anything else,” Mr Palmer said.

“Changing the faces won’t change the results.

“The Abbott government needs to stimulate and expand the Australian economy rather than create a false impression that Australia has a high debt level.”

Mr Palmer said Australia’s debt is only 12 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP).

“The OECD average is 73 per cent and Australia’s debt during the Menzies years was 40 per cent of GDP,” Mr Palmer said.

“The Abbott government should tell Australians the truth and take action to make their lives better.”",,

The electorate of Fairfax has gained an extra 291 aged care places in the latest Aged Care Approvals Round 2014, with an estimated value of $17.169 million dollars of approved funding from the Department of Social Services.

With the number of mature age individuals on the Sunshine Coast increasing, this is good news for the constituents of Fairfax.

Each applicant is subjected to rigorous assessment based on criteria prescribed in the Aged Care Act (1997). This year the department received two applications for every available residential care place and over seventeen applications for every home care place.

The following facilities have received these additional places:

·         Mt Coolum Aged Care Services.

·         Twin Waters Residential Care.

·         Living Choice Manor Sunshine Cove.

·         Regis Allora Lodge Allora Drive.

·         St Mary’s Coolum Beach.

“These extra residential and home care places will certainly help meet the growing demand for aged care facilities on the Sunshine Coast,” said Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer. 

“The facilities awarded this funding were assessed on the strength of their application, such as their ability to deliver care, management style, experience and expertise. This is a true indication of how advanced and professional the aged care industry is on the Sunshine Coast, so this recent announcement of funding for the electorate of Fairfax is an outstanding achievement for all concerned.”",,

The Member for Fairfax and leader of the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer, has said local community organisations in his electorate will again receive a donation drawn directly from the next instalment of his parliamentary salary.

Mr Palmer said he would continue to keep his promise to donate his parliamentary salary to community organisations in his electorate.

“The next instalment of my parliamentary salary will be drawn and donations will be made to more than 100 community organisations in the Fairfax electorate,” Mr Palmer said.

Community organisations to benefit from Mr Palmer’s electoral salary include Bli Bli Little Athletics Centre, Buderim War Memorial Community Association, Coolum Beach Quilters, Country Women’s Association at Kenilworth, Eumundi RSL, Indigenous Services, Maroochydore State High School, Nambour Indoor Bowls Association, Peregian Beach Community Kindergarten, RACQ Sunshine Coast Helicopter Rescue Service, Sunshine Coast Writers Group, Yandina Scouts and many, many more.

Mr Palmer said he was committed to giving back to his local electorate and community.

“Many Fairfax residents rely on these community organisations and not for profit groups in their daily lives and without financial or volunteer support many would have to close their doors or cease providing their important services,” Mr Palmer said.

“It is an honour to represent the Fairfax community and a privilege to be able to gift my parliamentary salary back to schools, sporting clubs, aged care facilities, veterans and RSL clubs, recreational groups, healthcare, environmental and search and rescue services.”",,

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says the Abbott government has succumbed to pressure from the Palmer United Party by dropping plans for the GP co-payment.

Mr Palmer said the Palmer United Party and its senators Glenn Lazarus and Dio Wang opposed the $7 co-payment because of the damage it would cause for the nation.

“The co-payment is dead and this is a victory for the Palmer United Party,” Mr Palmer said.

“Low income earners, single parent families, pensioners, nursing home patients and those who are socially or financially disadvantaged were to be hardest hit by this disastrous policy.

“It was a ruthless attack on Australians when savings can be made elsewhere in the budget.

“But Prime Minister Tony Abbott has succumbed to our rationale and dropped the co-payment.

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says the creation of the Safe Haven Enterprise Visa (SHEV), is a win for asylum seekers, the Palmer United Party team, regional Australia and the country as a whole. 

Mr Palmer said Mr Morrison’s proposed amendments to the Migration Act will get asylum seekers out of detention centres and into regional communities with labour shortages. 

Earlier negotiations between the Palmer United Party and the Government resulted in keeping 1,550 people in Australia who would have otherwise been from Christmas Island to mainland Australia, these people included 436 children and their families and 32 unaccompanied minors.

In a bid to secure Senate support for the revamped Migration Act, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has pledged to increase the annual humanitarian intake of refugees from 13,750 to 18,750 over the next four years.

He also announced that while the asylum seekers are processed, he would offer work rights.

“The Palmer United Party also wants all children and their families to be released from the Christmas Island detention centre by Christmas,” Mr Palmer said.

“The Senate passing the amended Migration Act will ensure this happens and the Palmer United Party is pleased to have played a key role in securing the children’s release. Mr Morrison is to be congratulated for his willingness to negotiate and make important concessions.

“SHEV asylum-seekers will be required to confine themselves to designated regional areas in Australia where there are currently severe labour shortages.”

Mr Palmer said he had always believed it was wrong to keep children behind bars.

“Whether they took this dangerous voyage with their parents, or were born in detention, every child deserves a safe and loving upbringing with a range of experiences, not just the inside of a cell or an exercise yard,” he said.

Jacqui Lambie

In January, 2014, Senator Jacqui Lambie at the instigation of failed former LNP Queensland Member of Parliament, Rob Messenger, supported the establishment of the Australian Defence Veterans Party (Lambie Party).

At the time, which was prior to Senator Lambie taking up a Senate seat, she was a paid, full time employee of the Palmer United Party as its organiser in Tasmania.

The question remains was she receiving disability payments from the Commonwealth for being unable to work while receiving a full time salary at the same time from the Palmer United Party?

Senator Lambie flew at the cost and expense of the Palmer United Party to Queensland and South Australia to visit veterans groups. She also met with Pauline Hanson.

Up until four days ago, the positions of President and Vice President of the ‘Lambie Party’ was shown as vacant but they were suddenly removed from the website when Senator Lambie realised the game was up.

The facts are that Jacqui Lambie was elected to the Senate by 22,000 Tasmanians that voted above the line for the Palmer United Party. She received only 1,500 odd votes herself.

She completed her deception by seeking to establish a public profile by using Palmer United to create conflict that did not exist and lied repeatedly to the media about her colleagues.

She continues to act dishonestly and lie about me and other party members to gain media attention.

Senator Lambie’s actions just seek to undermine the interests of the Australian people in preference to her own.

To gain public support she stated in the media she was standing up for veterans and Tasmanians but as the record shows and senators Glenn Lazarus and Dio Wang and the National Secretary of the Palmer United Party, Peter Burke, can confirm, she at no time brought any proposal in respect of Tasmania or veterans in the whole time she attend Palmer United Party parliamentary meetings.

As far as jobs go, she chose to employ three Queenslanders on her staff in preference to Tasmanians. Rob Messenger is her chief of staff while his wife also got a job move from Queensland. Senator Lambie’s other adviser is another Messenger crony who still lives in Queensland and draws a Commonwealth salary.

Rob Messenger was expelled from the Palmer United Party. Senator Lambie and her cohorts have never seen active military service and they just seek to use the veterans to gain political support so Senator Lambie’s mastermind Messenger, a Queenslander, can stand for a Tasmanian senate seat.

Tasmanians and veterans should not be fooled to support such people of little character who have never acted to improve the lot of veterans.

Having a person of questionable honesty who had previously been charged and convicted by the Australia Army has been a disappointment for the Palmer United Party.

Senator Lambie never declared her convictions prior to her endorsement for the Palmer United Party.",,

The Palmer United Party federal leader and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says Jacqui Lambie has lied to the Senate in a rant against him and has done so to cover up her own misgivings.

Mr Palmer today confirmed Senator Lambie had not spoken to him for a month and she had failed to return all his phone calls and attend parliamentary party meetings.

“This is because Senator Lambie’s planning to set up an alternate political party,” he said.

“Jacqui Lambie has not brought forward one proposal to the party about Tasmanians, the people who elected her, or about veterans.

“Her statements she has made about me today are false. She originally wrote to the Palmer United Party requesting we endorse her for the Senate.

“She just wants to have a fight about nothing which is not a rational way to behave as a respectable Senator. Also the statements she has made about voting against all government legislation in the Senate are untrue.

“She’s discussing with the government on how to reduce the RET for Tasmania so she won’t be voting against the government on that issue.  She’s also proposing a private members’ bill to link increases in parliamentary salaries to Australian Defence Force (ADF) pay.

“This is a meaningless and pointless gesture and she should know parliamentary salaries have been frozen for the next two years. Does she want to freeze ADF wages and deny them the 1.5 per cent rise the government is offering?”

Mr Palmer said it was obvious Senator Lambie was following the scripts of her Chief of Staff, Rob Messenger.

“It’s easy to whinge about problems but harder to find solutions,” he said. “Palmer United Party senators Glenn Lazarus and Dio Wang and myself are about trying to find solutions.”

EXCERPT: Palmer has been completely consistent in doing what he said he’d do – vote to abolish the carbon and mining taxes – and completely in accord with his stated beliefs in developing a set of policies in response to the surprise budget. For six months he has said he and his party would not agree to the Medicare co-payment, the harsh new arrangements for unemployed youth, an increase in university fees or “assets recycling,” and he hasn’t. Much of what he was willing to compromise on with the government involved issues and policies peripheral to his philosophy. His rapid deal-making, a legacy of his real-estate and mining-lease years and his ability to package and repackage sets of options at a rapid pace seemed to bamboozle people, to convince them that anything was up for grabs. Yet this was nothing more than the horse-trading that is a necessary part of politics everywhere else, but that has been lessened by the lock-step nature of the Australian party system. One layer down is a set of core values, which are close to the centre of Australian politics.

The announcement this week of an historic agreement between the United States and China to take affirmative action to reduce carbon emissions is great news for the planet.


I have repeatedly said that climate change is a global problem which must be dealt with on a global level. I am hopeful, as many will be, that this agreement is the start of a new approach to climate change where the United States and China, as two of the largest economies with two of the greatest emissions quotas, set an example for the rest of the world to follow.

Australia is of course among the countries who must respond positively to this news. The Palmer United Party has remained firm on our position regarding the Renewable Energy Target (RET). We have opposed the Abbott Government’s aim to reduce the RET and we will continue to oppose it.

The government’s dithering is eroding confidence in the renewable energy sector and Australia’s reputation as a responsible, forward-thinking member of the global community.

Businesses who have invested in the renewable energy sector are in a state of flux. This puts existing jobs, future employment opportunities and potential investment in a perilous position due to an understandable lack of confidence in the future of the industry under the current government.

It is clear the majority of Australians want to see progress by our nation towards cleaner renewable energy. Solar alone is now being used by almost 17 per cent of the total Australian population. This, along with set future incentives to establish new hydro-electric powers stations, solar and wind farms, will identify Australia as a global leader in renewable energy.

Palmer United will stand firm on our commitment to the RET, just as we stood firm on our commitment to maintain the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), despite the government’s wish to abolish the agency.

It is now the duty of Tony Abbott and his government to deliver a responsible position for Australia on the RET that is commensurate with our status in the global community.

You can be assured that the Palmer United Party will block any attempt by the Abbott Government to reduce or abolish the RET.

All the best,

Clive

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says he’s delighted the Electoral Commission Queensland (ECQ) has approved the registration of the Palmer United Party ahead of the coming state election.

Mr Palmer said the ECQ has advised the Palmer United Party it had ‘overwhelmingly’ exceeded its membership requirements - and a week before a November 17 deadline.

“We’re pleased the ECQ has confirmed the Palmer United Party has easily met its requirement of having 500 party members as we have thousands of members in Queensland,” he said.

Mr Palmer said confirmation of the Palmer United Party’s official registration in Queensland was an embarrassment for Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, in particular The Courier Mail newspaper which had published “nonsense stories” questioning the party’s legitimacy.

“The Courier Mail is acting as a cheer squad for the LNP and Premier Campbell Newman and is failing to provide its readers with fair, balanced and unbiased reporting,” he said.

“Well, Campbell Newman now has a major fight on his hands at the next election from the Palmer United Party.

“The Palmer United Party is the last sentry at the gate for Queenslanders and we will stand firmly against the LNP’s plans to dispose of state assets.

“If successful at the next Queensland election, our party will resume any state-owned assets that have been sold off, without providing compensation to private sector investors who bought into them.

“The LNP is merely supporting lobbyist friends who will earn millions in commission cheques for leasing these assets.

“A Queensland-elected Palmer United Party government would stimulate the economy and protect assets owned by Queenslanders.’’",,

Two exceptional young Sunshine Coast athletes have been rewarded by Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer MP, for their outstanding efforts in the sporting arena.

Elli Picken (18) and Alex Wright (17) both won their events at the recent Surf Ironman Series Under-19 Coolangatta Gold and have been recognised with a Sport Achievement Award from Mr Palmer.
The pair were comfortable winners in their respective races, which Mr Palmer says is just reward for their dedication and endless hours of training.

“I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to both Elli and Alex for their great success at the Surf Ironman Series Under-19 Coolangatta Gold and I’m delighted to be able to recognise their determination with these Sport Achievement Awards,” Mr Palmer said. 

“As local Fairfax electorate athletes, they are outstanding ambassadors for our community. 

“Their countless hours of training, dedication and enthusiasm have paid off with a great result.

“They also serve as an inspiration for Australians of all ages by encouraging us to set goals and using those goals as the driving force to fulfil our ambitions.

“They have my congratulations and best wishes for future success. I am confident they will keep up their good work and enjoy many more proud moments in their lives.”

In relation to Senator Lambie and her comments, she is very passionate about this issue as she did wear a uniform and served this country for more than 10 years. 

The beauty of democracy is that people are allowed to have their own positions on matters such as these.

The Palmer United Party will field candidates in all eight electoral regions of the Victorian Legislative Council (VLC) in the upcoming state election, the party’s federal leader Clive Palmer has announced.

Mr Palmer said the move would provide voters with the opportunity to make the government more accountable by handing the balance of power in the upper house of Victorian Parliament to the Palmer United Party.

“In every election we see the same wheel being spun and the Victorian people get the same result regardless of which party is elected,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“The Liberals have deserted their followers and Labor still has no direction. Let’s have a new wheel. Only the Palmer United Party can get Victoria moving in the right direction.

“With Palmer United Party candidates standing in each electoral region of the VLC in  this election, voters have the chance to make a real difference by giving our party the balance of power so we can keep the Victorian government accountable just as we have done with the federal government.’’

Mr Palmer has close ties with Victoria having been born in Footscray and living in Williamstown until the age of 10. A keen Western Bulldogs fan, he attended St Mary’s Primary School and his father founded radio station 3AK.

He said he was looking forward to offering a fresh start for Victorians during a special time in the nation’s history marked by the Anzac Centenary honouring the service and sacrifice of all those who have worn the Australian uniform.

“The brave men and women who have offered their service in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping missions around the world have done so for Australia, not the Liberal, Labor or any one party.

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer, has accused the Electoral Commission of Queensland (ECQ) of unconstitutional behaviour in ordering Palmer United Party members to confirm their membership in writing.

Mr Palmer said despite the party already providing the ECQ with 3000 names and addresses of paid-up members as per the State’s electoral act, the ECQ was now writing to individual Palmer United members requesting confirmation.

“This is an unnecessary and, in my view, unconstitutional act to ask people to do this when the ECQ already has more than enough proof that we have the requisite Queensland members.

“It is just another tactic by the LNP Government to interfere with democracy.

“This move by the ECQ is obviously being heavily influenced by the Newman Government and signals that a Queensland election is on the cards before Christmas,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“It is a tactic by the LNP hierarchy to have the Palmer United Party de-registered because of the threat it poses is government.

“The Palmer United Party is committed to getting to the truth for the people of Queensland and the government doesn’t like it,’’ Mr Palmer said.

Clive Palmer: “What you haven’t reported –only shown part of the news tonight is the fact that the government has agreed to 15 amendments to Direct Action that we’ve proposed, and its changed the entire face of it. They have also agreed to an additional 4 amendments by Senator Xenophon. So direct action that we talked about today is a long way different than the Direct Action I had referred to (previously), so it’s highly misleading to make that quote to mislead the Australian public.”

Clive Palmer, the leader of the Palmer United Party, discusses the deal he has made with the government to support the policy of direct action against climate change in return for an enquiry into an Emissions Trading Scheme.

FULL TRANSCRIPT:
 Tony Jones: Back now to our top story, Clive Palmer's deal with the Government to support its direct action climate policy. He joins us now from our Parliament House studios. Clive Palmer, thanks for being there.

Clive Palmer: Good evening, Tony, it's good to be here to see you.

TJ: Now, goodbye direct action, it's gone, a waste of money, we can't think of any reason to vote for it, we think it's hopeless. Did you believe any of those statements at the time you made them?

CP: I believed them then, I believe them now because what you haven't reported, only shown part of the news tonight is that the Government's agreed to 15 amendments to direct action that we've proposed and changed the entire face of it. They've agreed to an additional 4 amendments by Senator Xenephon. So direct action that we talked about today was a long way different than the direct action I referred to so it's highly misleading to make that quote, to mislead the Australian public.

TJ: So direct action now, this policy is the answer, is that right?

CP: It's part of the answer and something we can do in the short term. The Government was going to abolish the Climate Change Authority and we stopped that from happening. What you don't report is we've also got an undertaking from the Government not to produce any legislation in the session of Parliament to abolish the clean energy Corporation. Three things that the Greens were unable to achieve for Australia we've achieved. And then of course we've gone on, we've had the Climate Change Authority which we always wanted to, to be the monitoring authority to report back to Parliament in relation to our ETS. Now our ETS was different to the one the Labor Party and Christine Milne referred to. It was one that would take affect when our major trading partners also had an ETS such as Japan, Korea, the US, China and Europe and that was something that was always going to be monitored and reported on by the Climate Change Authority and the Government's agreed to do that and to fund that, report back to Parliament on 30 November this year - 30 June next year. And more importantly, in 2016, before the next election, after the international climate change held in Paris by the UN. So these are all major concessions. So we're heading towards an ETS we believe and we believe that's the right answer. President Obama has said that's what we must have. It's the biggest issue in our time. So we had to do it.

TJ: Is it agreed that this review will contain recommendations about whether Australia does or does not have or should or should not have an emissions trading scheme? It's not clear at all from today's press conference that is the case if it is.

CP: That's right and of course the big thing about the work being carried out by the climate change authority, it's done by the former Governor of the Reserve Bank Bernie phrase e it's independent from the government, it can be objective. This has been a 
 divisive debate, putting Australians against Australians. We need to unify in the country and do the right thing by the world. We've brought outcomes to this debate rather than talk about platitudes like the Greens have, like Christine Milne has. Bernie Fraser was saying that she wanted to be nominated to head the authority and he's 
 doing the inquiry. So really it needs to be more even handed and more fair.

TJ: Let's go back and try and get a direct answer to the question that I just asked. Will that review produce recommendations, specific recommendations as to whether or not Australia should have an emissions trading scheme?

CP: That's my understanding of it and that's the purpose of it.
 TJ: Well, not according to the press conference. The purpose of it is to review what other countries are doing?

CP: No, that's misleading again. Our ETS that we tabled in Parliament was one which would take effect when other countries had their ETS because from a totally non-environmental reason, for an economic reason, if you find China, Japan, Korea, the US and Europe have an ETS and we want to export to those countries our products will only be entered if we they pair ETS which means the revenues goes to those countries instead of Australia. We need to have that revenue paid to our country so our people get the benefit from it. From an environmental point of view that's the biggest issue facing the planet.

TJ: Do you have a commitment from Greg Hunt, the Minister, and the Government as to the terms of reference of this review?

CP: We've got it set out in a letter which will be tabled in the Senate which will set that detail out. The purpose of it is to recommend independently what the situation should be for Australia to Parliament. So the Australian people can make a clear judgment before the next election.

TJ: But the Climate Change Authority has already been operating on the assumption that there would be an emissions trading scheme, you wouldn't expect them to reverse that position, would you?

CP: It's an independent inquiry that's operating on different parameters from our ETS than what Labor had. As I explained to you, our ETS takes effect when our competitive trading partners have it so we don't lose jobs and we stay so markets are accessible to us.

TJ: Do you have any guarantee at all from the Government that they will act on any recommendation from the Climate Change Authority which, as we know, is a body which they sought to abolish?

CP: Well, we will act and we can introduce bills in the Senate. We'll act and we can introduce bills in the Lower House. We'll act in relation to that because an ETS is our policy. That's what we said Australia needs. That's what President Obama has said the world needs. So we'll certainly act.

TJ: Now PM Abbott has described emissions trading schemes as so-called market in the non-delivery of an invisible substance to nobody, to no-one. You've got to convince him, obviously that he's wrong in order to achieve an emissions trading scheme or to go back to the idea of an emissions trading scheme. Have you spoken to him at all to try to convince him that he's wrong about emissions trading schemes?

CP: Well Tony, you're getting things out of sequence. The reason we're having an inquiry is to come up with an answer.

TJ: You've already got the answer.

CP: We don't want to be prejudge the answer. If we want to be fair about this we've got to give the Climate Change Authority a chance to investigate this and come up with a recommendation. I think the PM and Greg Hunt have been good because they've moved their position and they've got an open mind to this issue. Something we didn't have previously in this debate. I think that's a good thing.

TJ: Sorry to interrupt you there, but what makes you think that they will have any respect for an authority which they wanted to abolish?

CP: Well, it's not a question of being respect for the Authority, it's for the report and its findings and we're talking about 18 months away, we've kept an ETS on the agenda. It was going to be abandoned by the Greens and by Labor and we haven't abandoned it and we think that's a good thing.

TJ: Until today you could say you had the whip hand in the negotiations. Why didn't you include retention of the renewable energy target in the deal that you cut with the Government?

CP: Well, our position is that we retain the RET and we've said that very publicly. Everyone knows that, the solar Council of Australia knows that. For them to change the target they've got to get something through the Senate. We hold the balance of power in the Senate. So that's just not going to happen.

TJ: Did you try to convince Greg Hunt that you should include the renewable energy target within this deal?

CP: No.

TJ: Why not?

CP: Because it's just a furphy. As I said, if you can count, Tony, we hold the balance of power in the Senate and we're against changing the RET so that's the end of the issue.

TJ: Well not quite. Is it still your firm decision that the RET should be maintained in its current 20% and not watered down at all?

CP: That's what we believe, yeah.

TJ: When you say we, does that include your PUP colleague Senator Lambie?

CP: That includes our party and our party has a policy and members vote for that policy and that we resolve that and that's our procedure just like the Labor Party does and just like the Liberal Party does. There will always be members in all parties who have different points of view.

TJ: But they won't necessarily have to vote all the same way, will they? In fact, Senator Lambie said she persuaded you that big businesses like the aluminium smelter in Tasmania should be exempted from the renewable energy target, is that correct?

CP: No, we haven't yet finalised our position on those things but we say the target should be the same. Whether you exempt someone from it is a different question. We're saying the target should be the same, that's the question you asked me.

TJ: So the exemption in fact could apply to aluminium smelters in Tasmania, is that what you're saying?

CP: That's a misrepresentation again.

TJ: No, actually it's not, it's a question based on what Jacqui Lambie said.

CP: Why don't you listen to what Clive Palmer says? I'm on the program, you're interviewing me. If you want to interview Jacqui Lambie invite her on. The electricity in Tasmania is generated by hydro. Hydro is clean energy. There's an anomaly in the bill that doesn't recognise that. If you have hydro-electricity it's clean energy. It's something that shouldn't be categorised the same as a coal-fired power station but on the current legislation that's how they deal with it. That's an anomaly not in the country's interest and we think it should be rectified.

TJ: So what you're saying is you wouldn't apply that criterion to other energy intensive aluminium smelters throughout the rest of the country, for example, the very thing that many of the Coalition MPs have gone to their own government about, arguing that it should be - they should be all removed from the RET?

CP: They could argue that if they want to. I'm talking about the source of the energy itself. It doesn't matter whether it's an aluminium smelter or whatever source. If electricity is coming from hydro that's clean energy and that's a good thing.

TJ: So do you want to keep the RET at 41,000 gigawatt hours? That's the key figure, isn't it?

CP: For the third time, Tony, yes, we do.

TJ: OK, and that includes - I just need to understand does that include Jacqui Lambie, you do have an issue because Jacqui Lambie talks a lot to the press and quite often she says things that contradict what you say.

CP: All we here on the ABC is our senators will not vote together. Every time in Parliament when these things have come up we vote together. Why don't you say that about the Liberal Party and the Labor and the Greens, why pick on us all the time? Do you think our senators lack integrity.

TJ: You hold some prominence by holding balance of power so of course we're going to be questioning you on these issues.

CP: Look at the track record. We've had a tremendous record the 4 months we've been there, we've stuck together and brought about some changes in Australian legislation. We've brought down electricity prices in this country by 10%. By hundreds of millions of dollars. You know, a party of four members of Parliament can do that because it's got the right ideas, it's got the interests of the people at heart. That's what we want our politicians to do. It's not about Labor or Liberal way, it's about the right way for the people that live in this country.

TJ: With respect, you sometimes say one thing and then completely change your mind and then do the opposite. So I'm just wondering whether this could be true with the RET as it is with other elements of your decision making?

CP: That's not true at all, Tony. It's just because you don't have a full understanding of legislation and what it holds. So you report it surfacely on the press. I have to look at the acts and the provisions and if we see there's 20 or 30 provisions in an act that means we can't pass it, we'll sit down with a Government. If they agree to change all of those provisions and we pass that act it doesn't mean we've changed our position, it's the Government that's changed their position.

TJ: Your position, as I understood it was, that taxpayers' money should not be used to pay big polluters to reduce their pollution. That was your initial position, you seem to have changed that one considerably?

CP: That was Christine Milne's position, Tony. That wasn't my position. I think people should have an incentive to bring down pollution and carbon and I think that's a good thing. And the RET, not the RET, the direct action policies as they now exist, different to how they were previously, will go a long way to achieving that. We've achieved a lot for indigenous people by having Savannah Burney involved in all of that. You can't always be negative. I mean the Greens always knock things and never achieve anything. Yet we've saved all of those key institutions that are the very foundation of our environmental movement.

TJ: Now Mr Hunt says the direct action policy will enable the Government to meet its commitment to a 5% cut to Australia's greenhouse emissions. Do you agree that the world and Australia will need to commit to much bigger targets and cuts in order to reduce global warming?

CP: Well, I think we want to see what happens in Paris. There's a whole lot of range of issues going on at the moment that have got to be reported on in the next 12-month period and you don't want to prejudge things, you keep an open mind. So you're objective and look at the facts. You don't prejudge things for partisan political reasons, you do what's best for the country.

TJ: There's a process. European leaders have agreed to a 40% cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Other industrialised nations are expected to reveal their long-term targets by April of next year ahead of the Paris climate conference in November. What do you think Australia's target should be?

CP: Well, I won't pre-empt the study. Part of that is looking at the targets is by Mr Fraser the Climate Change Authority. We've announced a study today, it will be quite improper for me to try to say what the results of that study would be before he's even done it.

TJ: That study, as I understand it, is not about the size of the target that Australia should adopt, it's about whether or not other countries are using emissions trading schemes?

CP: It looks at the size of the target we should adopt in consequence to how that comes together in a global position. Of course Australia's greenhouse gases in a total volume is a lot smaller than the European countries. You've got a lot of dirty industries established in Czechoslovakia, East Germany and other places. It talks about what time that's being judged by.

TJ: As a matter of principle, do you believe to use a direct action policy to make cuts greater than 5%?

CP: Of course it's possible, depending what resources you put at and what resources you do. They will be things Mr Fraser looks at. Our party policy is we believe an ETS is the only way for Australia in the future. We live in one world, air floats around the world, we all live on this planet and we all breathe the same air and we think it's very important that we have a global solution to after all is a global problem.

TJ: You would have heard the PM not so long ago talking about the great value of coal to sooiflisation and to the Australian economy and so on. Should Australia keep exporting coal at the same rate that it currently is when we know that coal is going to be burnt in dirty coal-fired power stations in other parts of the world?

CP: This is another issue which is not looked at correctly. If we have a look at a lot of coal exports in the world at the moment they come from Indonesia which has dirtier coal than Australia does. If you can replace those export markets that are being serviced by Indonesia with Australian coal you will bring down about 35% of the emissions that would be generated by using the dirty coal in China just because it's cheaper. So I think Australian coal has got a great role to play in bringing down emissions by changing a lot of power stations that are using sub-quality coal at the moment to a premium product.

TJ: Is that an idea that you ran past Al Gore when you had him in Australia because one wonders whether he would agree with that?

CP: Well anything you can do to reduce emissions I'm sure Al Gore would agree with.

TJ: We're nearly out of time, do you think there's a permanent future for coal exporters in Australia?

CP: Well I think there is a future, Tony. Our second biggest industry is coal export. If we can export cleaner coal then we're making a great contribution to mankind.

TJ: So coal is in fact, Australian coal you regard as a great contribution to mankind?

CP: I think in a global sense it is when we look at the dirty coal, depends on what sort of coal you're talking about. Oils ain't oils, Tony. You've got to look at what you're trying to achieve.

TJ: Clive Palmer,mer Kewellial as ever, thank you for joining us tonight.

CP: It's great to be with Australia's greatest journalist

The Palmer United Party has successfully negotiated with the Abbott Government to consider major amendments to carbon farming, retaining the Climate Change Authority and agreeing to a three-stage, 18-month enquiry into an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer says the enquiry into major environmental initiatives including the benefits of the Palmer United Party’s ETS would be undertaken by former governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bernie Fraser in his capacity as chairman of the Climate Change Authority.

In a unifying move for all Australians, Mr Palmer said the enquiry was expected to report back to parliament in June 2015 with a further advanced report in November 2015 prior to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris and the final report completed by June 30, 2016. 

Mr Palmer said the Palmer United Party had achieved what the Greens were unable to in preserving the Climate Change Authority, retaining the Renewable Energy Target (RET) and making substantial progress towards delivering an ETS. “We would expect Green votes to flow to Palmer United Party on the back of this achievement which will deliver tangible results for the environment, not just talk,’’ Mr Palmer said.

The Palmer United Party proposes an ETS which will only become effective once Australia’s main trading partners also took action to establish one.

“In understanding climate change, we must remain ever vigilant and be aware of how Australia as part of the international community is doing and, more importantly, what the global community can do together to make the lives of all those who inhabit the world more secure,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“I congratulate Tony Abbott and Environment Minister Greg Hunt on their political courage in supporting this proposal which will benefit all Australians and unify the nation,’’ he said.

“This will be an important step forward for Australia in 2015 as we commemorate the Anzac Centenary honouring the service and sacrifice of all those who have worn the Australian uniform.

“The brave men and women who have offered their service in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping missions around the world have done so for Australia, not Liberal, Labor or any one party.

“This new ETS for all Australians is not the Liberal way or the Labor way but the right way,’’ Mr Palmer said. “It is an example of the Palmer United Party delivering real results for everyday Australians through a common-sense approach,’’ he said.

The Palmer United Party federal leader and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says the party will seek a Senate inquiry into the activities of the Northern Territory government following moves to scrap an independent investigation into NT political donations.

Support from Palmer United Party MLAs Alison Anderson and Larisa Lee led to the passing for a motion in the NT Assembly for an independent inquiry into electoral funding in the NT.

But the Country Liberal Party (CLP) government has moved in parliament for the inquiry to be scrapped.

Mr Palmer said the CLP’s actions were a disgrace and they must have something to hide.

“The Palmer United Party senators will seek to have a federal investigation into NT government activities as we don’t want the Territory to end up like NSW,” he said.

“I strongly supported the stance of our Palmer United Party parliamentarians in the NT and the need for an inquiry into political donations as well as their plea for more honest, open and transparent government.

“There is obviously a lack of leadership and chaos in the NT. A full and proper independent investigation into the political donations issue and the activities of organisations such as the CLP-aligned Foundation 51 was essential.

“The Palmer United Party will ensure Territorians have the leadership and government they deserve.”

Ms Anderson, the Palmer United Party’s NT leader and member for Namatjira, said Territorians demanded transparency, honesty and trust from government.

“We need to show Territorians we are sincere and we are here to represent them,” she said.

“We need to make sure the integrity of this parliament and the individual people in this parliament is given back to the people.”",,

Mr Palmer said Mr Marcinkowski  is a keen and driven candidate.
“He has been an active and hardworking member of the party since the very beginning in 2013 and previously assisted candidates in the 2013 federal election,” Mr Palmer said.

“Mr Marcinkowski is looking forward to representing his local community as the party’s candidate for Gaven and is highly motivated to run against the current Independent, Dr Alex Douglas.
“I would also like to thank my wife, Anna Palmer, and Edward Fricker who both submitted nominations for the seat of Gaven.”

Mr Marcinkowski said he is delighted with his pre-selection and is looking forward to working with the people of Gaven to tackle local issues.

“I have lived in and around the electorate for the last 12 years and believe that I am best placed to represent the people and take action to ensure the best benefits for the community,” he said.

“I want the people of Gaven to know that I firmly believe in loyalty and integrity. I will stand for a cause and represent them to the best of my ability as a member of the Palmer United Party.”

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says the people of Newcastle need better access to cleaner and less expensive energy sources such as solar power. 

Mr Palmer, who was joined in Newcastle by the CEO of the Australian Solar Council, John Grimes, said the Palmer United Party was committed to saving Novocastrians money. 

“It’s important the people of Newcastle have better access to clean energy,” he said. 

“Electricity is too expensive. An average household will reduce its power bill by 65 per cent when it installs solar. Two million Australian households have done this and millions more want to get solar power including thousands of Novocastrians.” 

Mr Palmer said encouraging Australian home owners to put solar panels on their roofs was a great way to protect them from higher electricity prices. 

“People on low incomes, self-funded retirees, pensioners and community groups are among those who will be able to slash their power bills,” he said. 

Mr Palmer said any move by the Abbott government to reduce or abolish the Renewable Energy Target (RET) was irresponsible and would not be supported by the Palmer United Party. 

""The RET has to be retained. Australia needs to move towards cleaner renewable energy sources such as solar power and the RET supports this,” he said. 

“The RET was also responsible for creating 24,000 new jobs and if left unchanged will create an additional 18,400 jobs by 2020.”",,

Federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, has called on Tony Abbott to intervene in the Australian Defence Force pay dispute to ensure a better deal for uniformed personnel.

Mr Palmer said the proposed lower-than-inflation 1.5 percent  annual pay rise for sailors, soldiers and air force personnel over the next three years was highly disrespectful to the men and women who made such enormous sacrifices for their country.

“This is an outrageous proposal and our defence members have every right to feel short-changed,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Tony Abbott should intervene immediately to reject the current offer before the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal and consider a much better deal for our servicemen and women in line with 2.5% inflation or above,’’ he said.

“Telling the nation’s nearly 60,000 men and women in uniform that a miserly 1.5 percent pay rise is all that can be managed in the current budget climate is a joke considering the sacrifices they make.

Examination of certain government actions impacting the lives of Queensland citizens was within the powers of the Senate Inquiry into the Newman Government, the federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said today.

Mr Palmer said the Senate Inquiry into the Queensland Government was not unprecedented, citing the Liberal dominated Senate Inquiry into the 1993 Heiner Affair and 2007 Traveston Dam inquiry as previous examples.

“The establishment of the Lazarus inquiry follows precedence,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“It was set up as a result of the public coming forward in relation to matters of concern in Queensland Government, in particular the extensive cutting of funding and services to regional areas of the state.

“Also, questions need to be answered in regards to State Government decisions on developer approvals and whether they were given for good and proper reasons or for improper purposes.

“And most notably, the introduction of retrospective legislation for business operators and developers which makes certain illegal activity now legal needs to be examined,’’ he said.

Mr Palmer said questions also needed to be asked in respect to political donations which may coincide with these issues.

He said the inquiry could examine the decline of the Queensland economy, the lack of business confidence and the loss of faith in the Queensland legal system.

“There has been political interference in relation to judicial appointments and the processes in running our legal system which affects us all,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“The inquiry is not about individuals, it is issues-based and was set up by a majority of Australian senators from the Labor Party, The Greens and Palmer United Party.

“Put simply, the inquiry received majority support in the Senate this week, which is why it went ahead. Senators responded to the wishes of their constituents who are rightly concerned about honesty and consistency in the Queensland Government.

“There is no Upper House in Queensland and therefore the role of the senators is more crucial.

“For some to suggest the inquiry was established for my own personal reasons is untrue,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“I have vested interest in good government in Australia. As an Australian and Queensland citizen and elected representative of the Australian people, I have a duty and obligation to represent those who have elected me.

“This is an opportunity for citizens of Queensland to let the inquiry know what has gone wrong in Queensland.

“People should have the right to express their concerns and this inquiry lets them do that. It is democracy at work.

 The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer announced today that his party would support a joint initiative with the Abbott Government to set up a new visa.
 The Government is introducing this new visa into parliament.

 Mr Palmer said negotiations with the Government and the Minister for Immigration the Honourable Scott Morrison had resulted in keeping 1,550 people in Australia who would have otherwise been transferred to Nauru or Manus Island from Christmas Island and mainland Australia. These people include 436 children and their families and 32 unaccompanied minors.

 This arrangement would also see processes to allow the caseload of 30,000 Illegal Maritime Arrivals (IMAs) to be resolved, resulting in billions of dollars of savings to the Australian Government and positive contributions to the Australian economy.

 Mr Palmer said Palmer United Party negotiations with the Government have ensured the introduction of a new visa to be known as the Safe Haven Enterprise Visa (SHEV).

 The SHEV encourages enterprise through earning and learning while also strengthening regional Australia.

 The visa would be valid for five years and allows for the visa holder to be located in a region identified through a national nomination process. 

 Areas identified are those locations in Australia where labour resources are most needed.

“These visa holders will be targeted to regions and encouraged to fill regional vacancies,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Following full employment and positive community involvement for a period of 3.5 years, the visa holder can apply for an onshore visa. 

“Holders of SHEVs will be eligible for work rights, access to employment services and mutual obligations, Medicare, trauma counselling, translation services, complex case support and access to education for school aged children,’’ he said.

 During the five year period, visa holders have an opportunity to provide bona fides and contribute to Australian society by paying taxes and adding to the economy’s productivity levels.

 Mr Palmer said these changes will help Australia and allows for a crucial stepping stone for refugees to make a positive contribution to Australian society.

“It’s a win, win situation,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“It’s a win for refugees who now have a safe haven visa and can protect themselves and work towards establishing themselves in an Australian community. 

“And it’s a win for regional Australia, which will benefit from the additional work resources in communities where there is a labour shortage, thereby increasing the viability of these areas.”

Mr Palmer said the Government had also agreed to cease transferring people, who arrived prior to December 19, 2013 and are currently on the Australian mainland and Christmas Island, to Nauru or Manus Island for offshore processing.

 The Government has also agreed to continue to support assisted voluntary return packages, particularly as a mechanism to reunite unaccompanied minors with their families in their home countries.
“The Palmer United Party will support these measures as they reduce billions of dollars of expenditure which can be used for crucial services including health and education. 

“They also give refugees certainty to re-establish themselves into a normal Australian lifestyle.

“The Palmer United Party would like to thank the Government and congratulate Minister Morrison on his open mind and willingness to resolving the unprocessed caseload of 30,000 illegal maritime arrivals in Australia,” Mr Palmer said.

Check out this economists statement  below - do you agree? Don't forget to check out the extensive signature list at the bottom. 

Economists’ Statement on Commonwealth Budgetary and Economic Priorities 

September 2014
The austere measures contained in the proposed Commonwealth budget have been justified by fears that Australia’s public debt is expanding rapidly and dangerously, and must be arrested through a dramatic change in fiscal policy. These fears are misplaced.

Australia does not face any present or imminent debt crisis. Australia’s deficit and accumulated debt are both low, relative to international experience and Australia’s own history. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the current net debt (for all levels of government) in Australia is equivalent to 13.8 percent of GDP – less than one-fifth the average debt burden carried by other industrial economies (and an even smaller fraction of the debt in countries like the U.S., the U.K., and Japan). Since the GFC, debt has grown less rapidly here than in other countries. Interest rates paid on Australian debt are at record-low levels (and likely to stay that way for years), further reducing the burden of net interest payments. In short, Australia’s ability to manage public debt is very strong.

The major cause of the current gap between revenues and expenditures of the Commonwealth government is continued cyclical weakness in macroeconomic performance. The employment rate has declined markedly, and continues to decline in the face of recent lay-offs and weak job-creation. Incomes have been growing at their slowest pace in decades (consequently constraining consumer spending). These trends, combined with large tax cuts during the early stages of the mining boom, have undermined tax revenues from personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and the GST.
The most effective route to restored fiscal balance is to help more Australians find work, earn incomes, and pay taxes. But major and unnecessary reductions in government program spending and public sector employment would have the opposite effect.

The goal of fiscal policy is not simply to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible, nor is it to generate surpluses (government is not, after all, a “profit-making business”). The timing and method of deficit reduction must be balanced with other economic and social goals, including job-creation, infrastructure needs, and social conditions. Governments’ economic responsibility is to establish policies which support Australian firms, workers, and communities to utilise their full potential to work, produce, generate income, and sustainably consume.

When spending and demand conditions in the private sector of the economy are sub-optimal (as they have been, and continue to be), government has a responsibility to play a leading role in supporting economic activity and job-creation. At times, this responsibility requires deficit financing of public programs and infrastructure investments.

There are many projects and priorities which would enhance Australia’s productive capacity in the future, and hence are deserving of more government support, not less. These include investments in transportation, energy conservation and alternative energy, and affordable housing. When a new public investment project enhances the economy’s long-run productive potential, it is economically prudent to finance it with public debt (just as private firms and households finance long-lived investments with their own debt).
The true goal of fiscal policy is the need to ultimately stabilise the level economic activity at full employment. We should not be satisfied until unemployment is back to rates Australia enjoyed in the early post war decades. Debt and deficits should not be targets in their own right but simply treated as by-products of the required fiscal strategy.

International agencies (such as the International Monetary Fund and the G-20) have urged extreme caution in future fiscal retrenchment, for fear that indiscriminate spending reductions will undermine growth and job-creation – ultimately defeating the goal of fiscal balance. They have acknowledged that past polices of austerity in other countries have had large negative effects on growth and employment.
Australia should not make the same mistake. Major spending reductions by the Commonwealth government are economically unnecessary and socially damaging. The first priority of Australian fiscal policy should be to strengthen investment, employment, and growth. Government can and should pursue this priority without jeopardizing its long-run fiscal strength and stability.

The majority of Australians are clearly committed to the retention of the current Renewable Energy Target (RET), according to the federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer.

Mr Palmer said polling conducted by the Solar Citizens Organisation in the southern areas of the Sunshine Coast found 96 per cent of the population questioned were either in support of increasing the RET or keeping it as it is.

He said there is an ever increasing need to see all Australians move towards more cleaner renewable energy sources, while PricewaterhouseCoopers has revealed Australia as the world’s “unexpected champion” in its reduction of emissions for a second year running.

“This is a clear indication that the Abbott government needs to place greater emphasis on the RET and what benefits it will deliver to the Australian people, increased job security, and continued growth with year on year investment from external investors,” Mr Palmer said.

“Senior government figures, including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, reportedly want the target scrapped, saying it has forced up power prices (Sydney Morning Herald 8.8.14). This clear need for change will cause increased levels of uncertainty and will draw investors to retract funding, costing the Australian economy up to $28 billion and 5000 jobs.

“Solar alone is now being used by almost 17 per cent of the total Australian population. This along with set future incentives to establish new solar and wind farms, hydroelectric powers stations will identify Australia as the global leader in renewable energy.”",,

Barton Solar Forum

Dear All,
 Firstly congratulations to you all for being here tonight. It is only by the concerted actions like this from ordinary members of the community that we will force the politicians in Canberra to listen. A thank you to the Australian Solar Council for the opportunity to have this statement read, for putting on this forum and the many others you have organised. This is real people power in action.

When the review of the Renewable Energy Target was announced, the Prime Minister said that the RET was causing 'pretty significant price pressure in the system’.

The Prime Minister must now admit that he was wrong as his own review of the RET undertaken by Warburton suggests impacts on retail electricity prices appear to be small.

If government is truly concerned about the cost-of-living pressure on Australian families, as it has repeatedly claimed, then it would be announcing today that it has no intention of making any changes to the RET.

Putting solar panels on your roof is a great way to protect your family from higher electricity prices. Millions of households have done it and many more millions want to. The changes to the Small scale Renewable Energy Scheme proposed by the Warburton RET review threaten ordinary Australians from being able to significantly reduce their electricity bills. The review proposed changing the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme, which helps working Australians put solar PVs and solar hot water on their roofs. If this government is really concerned about cost-of-living pressures on ordinary Australians, it should announce that it is rejecting these changes to the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme.

Before the election, the Prime Minister promised to cut the cost of living for everyday Australians. Installing solar is one guaranteed way people have to slash their power bills. On average, a household will slash its power bill by 65 per cent when it installs solar. There are two million households that prove this point, and there are millions more that want to get solar. People on low incomes, self-funded retirees, pensioners and community groups have all invested their own money to slash their power bills. Moving to the issue of industry uncertainty, when the government was elected it claimed that Australia was open for business. This stands in stark contrast to the instability that the government has created in the renewable energy sector and the entire market space more broadly. The uncertainty that the RET review has created is causing billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs to be put at risk. The government needs to bring this uncertainty to a swift end by standing by its election promise that there will be no adverse changes to the RET. The renewable energy industry is a thriving sector helping to deliver jobs, economic growth and more sustainable ways of powering our energy needs - while at the same time protecting our planet. Some polls suggest over 90% of Australians want Australia to continue to invest in greener, cleaner energy.

The RET was responsible for creating 24,000 new jobs and if left unchanged will create an additional 18,400 jobs by 2020. If the Prime Minister wants a prosperous and wealthy Australian economy, then we should be using every resource that we can to support this country. If we have a huge amount of untapped resources above our heads, such as sunlight and wind, we should capture it and use it to power our economy.

Clearly the Renewable Energy Target is good for the renewable energy sector, it is good for our economy, it is good for our environment – but most importantly is good for all Australians – because Australians understand the importance of taking care of our planet and want cheaper, greener and more sustainable energy.
 The renewable energy target is a real, tangible way for Australia to meet the needs of our people.

And finally my message to you is –‘we are winning’! Tony Abbott and those in Government who wanted to wreck the RET are on the back foot. Since the Palmer United Party made its commitment with former US Vice President Al Gore to save the RET, the debate has turned round. 

We recently declared Mr Warbuton’s report was ‘dead on arrival’ and we think many on the Liberal backbench think the same. They don’t want to go to an election being anti- renewables.

 The Palmer United Party will block any attempt by the Government to remove or reduce the Renewable Energy Target. This is our commitment to the people of Australia and we will do everything within our power to ensure the target is retained.",,

“The Abbott Government needs to do what is best for all Australians and what is in Australia’s national interest,’’ Mr Palmer said.

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, has called on the federal government to end its destruction of the Australian university system through deregulation.

“We need to return to a free higher education system for Australian students so everybody can have the same dreams and aspirations about bettering themselves and this nation, regardless of their circumstances.”

Queensland Government health cuts continued to create extreme shortages of health care workers in the state’s rural and remote areas, Palmer United Party federal leader and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer said today.

Doctors and nurses were being forced to work double the amount of hours to cope with the demand, Mr Palmer said.  

Figures released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare highlight a fundamental increase in the number of professional health care workers in major cities compared with the bush.

The city figure is 426 full time workers for every 100,000 residents compared to just 257 for every 100,000 people in remote areas, with the majority of those professionals being nurses or midwives.

The Rural Doctors Association has said there is a significant need for change, with simply not enough doctors in remote towns to cope with the demand. 

“This is an intolerable situation which the Newman government needs to fix as a matter of priority,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“For too long Campbell Newman has been focusing on peripheral matters rather than the health and welfare of Queenslanders.

“The Newman Government needs to place more emphasis on retraining those health professionals within the inner cities, so that they have the necessary skill levels to be able to relocate to assist those areas in the bush that need better health services.”",,

Government Support for Australia Fund Committee

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, says a proposal for federal parliament to establish a joint parliamentary committee to investigate creating an Australia Fund has won government support.

Mr Palmer said the committee would examine ways to provide support for Australia’s rural and manufacturing industries and provide immediate assistance in the fastest possible time to Australians in need following natural disasters such as drought, bushfires and floods.

“Government by its very nature is slow to act and parliament is slower to take action,” he said.

“But when there is a natural disaster and major economic needs, the response by government needs to be better than it has been. The financial muscle of the Commonwealth has rarely been flexed as it could be to assist Australians in time of need.”

Mr Palmer said the Australia Fund, which he first raised in parliament in February this year, would have the ability, on the basis of an assessment of the industry and/or businesses, to provide emergency and on-going drought/flood/bushfire relief, loan money to businesses, act as a guarantor for loans, capitalise or waive interest, purchase existing bank loans, and assume control of relevant property of the business for a specified time.

“In this way, the fund would be designed to enable businesses to continue operations to earn revenue, employ workers and pay taxes, rather than be prematurely wound up, and support communities affected by natural disasters,” he said.

“It would also provide funds for industry and/or company restructuring and the acquisition of new technologies to make businesses more economically viable and internationally competitive.”

Mr Palmer said as part of its investigation on the need for the fund, the joint parliamentary committee would undertake hearings in all capital cities and major rural centres and examine the impact on rural Australia of on-going drought and world market price fluctuations for primary industry produce.

“The committee’s terms of reference also include reviewing existing bankruptcy and insolvency laws with the aim of introducing legislation designed to assist companies to trade through difficult times, rather than be closed down,” he said.

The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, has called on Queensland Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney to apologise to Queenslanders for making false allegations to the state’s corruption watchdog.

Mr Palmer said the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) decision not to take any action over Mr Seeney’s allegations he corruptly tried to influence the state government made a fool of the Deputy Premier.

“Jeff Seeney has been caught out making false allegations and wasting taxpayers’ money with his complaint to the CCC,” he said.
“He is a disgrace and a liar and he should apologise to the people of Queensland and his party room for bringing the LNP into disrepute.”

Mr Palmer said Mr Seeney has lied about him submitting a draft bill at a meeting held between them on April 13, 2012, that would supposedly give Waratah Coal control over the Galilee Basin in central Queensland.

“Waratah Coal never sought to obtain exclusivity over the Galilee Basin or seek to exclude others,” Mr Palmer said.

Mr Palmer has commenced legal proceedings for defamation against Mr Seeney and also Queensland Premier Campbell Newman. Any damages awarded will be donated to charity.

The Palmer United Party is pushing for a Senate inquiry into the activities of the Newman government.",,

Clive Palmer has commended high achieving Year 12 students in his electorate of Fairfax who have been awarded the prestigious Australian Student Prize in recognition of their academic feats.

Joshua Sheehy from Sunshine Coast Grammar School, Claire Blaga from St Theresa’s Catholic College, Kelcie Bourne from Matthew Flinders Anglican College and Nambour State High’s Pippa Edwards, have all received their Australian Student Prize certificate, along with $2000 in prize money from the Australian Government. All were nominated by state certification and assessment authorities.

“I’m delighted for these young Australians who have seen their outstanding efforts rewarded with the Australian Student Prize. I wish them well in their future endeavours,” Mr Palmer said.

“We must encourage our young people to get the most from their education and continue to bring new thinking to a wide range of issues and topics.

“They are the future of this country and it is our duty to ensure that every young Australian is presented with the opportunity to enjoy a comprehensive and vibrant education system.”

The Abbott Government’s unpopular GP co-payment plan would not survive according to Clive Palmer whose Palmer United Party Senators today reaffirmed their commitment to vote against it.

“As far as the Palmer United Party is concerned, the $7 GP co-payment is history,’’ party leader and Federal Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer said.

“You can talk to all the analysts and crunch all the numbers you want but the fact of the matter is the Palmer United Senators will not be changing their position and the co-payment will not be getting through,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“We have been inundated with calls from real Australians and the message is very clear that they do not want it. 

“It is another cost they simply can’t afford and the Palmer United Party cannot allow more pain to be inflicted on ordinary Australians who are already doing it tough under Tony Abbott.”

“Low income earners, single parent families, pensioners, nursing home patients and those who are socially or financially disadvantaged will be hardest hit by a GP co-payment. It is a ruthless attack on Australians when savings can be made elsewhere in the budget.

Palmer United’s Queensland Leader and candidate for Kawana, Mr Carl Judge, has slammed the sitting Sunshine Coast LNP MPs for their silence on cost of living issues and unemployment across the region. 

The criticism comes off the back of a ‘Channel 7 State We're In Survey Report Card’ exposing the Newman Government’s failure to fulfil key election promises. 

It was reported that 57% of people rate the Newman Government’s performance on cutting the cost of living as poor.  

“The recently released unemployment figures for the Sunshine Coast region also confirms that the LNP is performing poorly in creating jobs,” Mr Judge said.  

There are now 13,000 jobless people on the Sunshine Coast with the unemployment rate seasonally adjusted to 7.7% in June 2014. Mr Judge expressed particular concern about the high rate of youth (15 to 24-year-old) unemployment which increased from 11.9% in July 2013 to 14.1% in July 2014.  

He was also critical of the Newman Government’s management of TAFE.  

“TAFE fees have skyrocketed under Newman Government,” Mr Judge said. 

“This is a real cost of living pressure, especially for young people, and it presents a significant barrier to accessing education and skills to equip people for future employment.”

Mr Judge pointed toward the Palmer United fight at the federal level of politics to protect pensioners from being charged a GP co-payment as evidence that his party is committed to controlling cost of living for constituents. 

“The Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, and Queensland Senator, Glenn Lazarus, have both been very vocal to protect the most vulnerable. They have also taken a strong stance to stop soaring tertiary education fees for students.

“Conversely, the LNP MPs on the Sunshine Coast are sitting silently and avoiding ownership of these very serious issues. They can’t hide from the facts and we won’t let them,” Mr Judge said.",,

 Here is the first Clip. Its under 3 minutes, so worth the look and the time to share. PUP say NO to the Budget. 

 CLIVE PALMER: What's wrong with this budget is it's just not fair. It’s just not reasonable to people and all of Australia knows it. We've got to remember that our debt really is 12% of our GDP and the average debt in the OECD is 73% of GDP. We're the third-lowest debt country in the OECD and what the boffins go on about is the projections. Well, you know, we had the global financial crisis a few years ago. I've been in business for years. Everyone knows the economy changes. We have wars, we have a whole range of things every four or five years, but all of these people are worried about what happens in 20 or 30 years. You know, I had four women come to see me in my electorate office aged between 68 and 86 and they said that their husbands always voted Liberal, they’d always voted Liberal and they didn't vote for me. They'd served in the Second World War, their three husbands, who were deceased, the other one in Korea and they said that their pension is paid to the nursing home and they get $15 back for incidentals every week and every Friday the four of them pool their money together and they go down to Maroochydore cinema to see a movie, have a coffee and have a chocolate and come home but under the co-payment, they can't go to the movies anymore. I didn't get elected to parliament to tag off someone’s coffee and chocolate from an old lady that mightn't be here in three or four years time. I got elected to look after the people that are here in Australia now, not people that might be here in 20 or 30 years time and I don’t want to destroy the values of this country and I assure all Australians that we will stand as the last sentry at the gate. 

 *There will be no co-payment. 

 *There will be no changes to the education establishments in Australia. 

 *There will be no deregulation of universities. 

 That's why people elected us and that's what we're going to do.

 TONY JONES: You've just named a number of things. What about the fuel tax hike? That’s where that started. 

 CLIVE PALMER: I don't want to upset Warren tonight too much but...

 WARREN TRUSS: You already have.

 PENNY WONG: Too late.

 CLIVE PALMER: But the reality of it is is when we got rid of the carbon tax, part of the carbon tax was a rebate on diesel fuel. That's now being re-introduced as a change to excise so it's about mirrors. The Australian people don't want mirrors. They want the truth. So we won't vote for that or for the indexation. You’ll see...

 TONY JONES: So no matter what is said to you?

 CLIVE PALMER: That’s right, yeah.

 TONY JONES: Because this is a period of intense negotiation. Are you determined to reject all of these things?

 CLIVE PALMER: Well, on the things that I’ve just mentioned tonight, you can't negotiate because they're the very fabric of the nation that we live in. You can't sell out of Australia and you can't sell out on the Australian people.

Palmer United Party federal leader and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, has called for the immediate closure of immigration detention camps because of their huge human and financial cost.

“Australia needs to move quickly to close these detention centres and implement a scheme to deal with the issue in a better way,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“The human and financial cost is too great if we are to continue with the Government’s current policy. Now is the time to make the change,’’ he said.

“On top of the very worrying human rights issues, the financial burden of running these centres is unjustifiable at a time when the government is cutting back its support to single mothers, families and pensioners.”

 What a political party can achieve for the community is far more important than the role of a leader, according to the federal leader of the Palmer United Party and member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer.

“It is very important for good government that parliamentarians representing any political party are not by virtue of their position able to dictate the pre-selection of candidates,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Alex Douglas has had no role in selecting the four candidates announced so far by the Palmer United Party including himself for the Queensland State Election.”

Mr Palmer said Dr Douglas had sought a special role for himself and his wife Susie that was not provided for in the constitution of the party, to effectively veto candidates.

“It was made clear to him that the Palmer United Party could not allow this to happen,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Corruption and the role of lobbyists will only flourish if such practices are allowed. Campbell Newman has been guilty of dictating to the LNP organisation and the Palmer United Party was not established to repeat a mistake like that.”

Mr Palmer said that having the Queensland parliamentary leader concentrating on parliamentary matters reassured the community that no deals could be done in the selection process which would compromise anyone’s obligation to the community.

“Alex Douglas is the nephew of Bob Katter and it had become clear to me that there was major conflict of interest. He is influenced by his uncle and on a number of occasions had sought to merge the Palmer United Party with Katter’s Australian Party.

“The fact is the Palmer United Party is not the Katter party and never will be, nor will we ever merge.”

Mr Palmer said a state parliamentary leader had a duty to be loyal to the party and its constitution.

“Dr Douglas failed that test by putting his quest for power ahead of the ideals and principles upon which the Palmer United Party was founded,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“His press release issued yesterday without any prior notice or consultation with the party confirms his inability to understand the safeguards of separating organisational matters from parliamentary roles.”

Mr Palmer said the Palmer United Party required its parliamentary members to put serving the community first.

“The safeguards established by Palmer United Party national director Peter Burke assures that only candidates loyal to the party and all that it represents can be pre-selected as candidates for the state election,’’ he said.",,

“Carl Judge has a strong commitment to Queensland and he has the character to lead the party to confront the many challenges the state now faces,” Mr Palmer said.

Mr Judge is the Member for Yeerongpilly in state parliament and will contest the Sunshine Coast seat of Kawana against Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie at the next state election.

Campbell Newman was to blame for Queensland’s unemployment rate reaching its highest level in more than a decade, according to the federal Leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer.

“As the Premier of Queensland he is responsible for the unemployment rate climbing to almost 7.0 per cent,’’ he said.

“He calls himself Can Do Campbell but all he ‘Can Do’ is create unemployment.”

Mr Palmer said the Newman government had a “can’t do” attitude in not allowing Queensland individuals and companies to participate in the economy thereby driving growth and creating jobs.

“This has resulted in ever increasing unemployment and more businesses closing or spiralling backwards,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Campbell Newman has destroyed domestic demand resulting in businesses downsizing and shutting their doors.”

The scheme has already faced fierce opposition within Mr Abbott's own ranks, with several MPs and senators openly opposing it in its current form.

But Mr Palmer's comments have virtually sounded the death knell for the PPL, with Labor opposed and government negotiations with The Greens - the only group open to the scheme - stalled.

Mr Palmer said the scheme was ""simply inequitable"" and had the potential to disadvantage mothers in rural Australia and lower income women, while ""highly paid mothers"" in suburbia would benefit.

He said despite asking to talk to the government, no negotiations had occurred recently, amid some reports the government may have already shelved it completely.

Press Release starts here:

Palmer United Protects the Rights of all Australians
A range of new consumer protection measures proposed by the Palmer United Party were agreed to by the Federal Government today in a major win for everyday Australian investors and responsible financial advisors.

Following discussions with the Palmer United Party over the Future of Financial Advice (FoFA) laws, The Minister for Finance, Mathias Cormann, on behalf of the Government, has tabled a letter in the Senate today stating that the Government will make further regulations within 90 days to ensure key changes to improve affordable, high quality financial advice, removing unnecessary and costly red tape, while protecting investors.

Palmer United Party federal leader and Member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, said his party could only support financial advice laws that were “fair for all Australians”.

The government has agreed to Palmer United’s strengthened consumer protection provided by financial advisers to their clients and signed off by both.

These measures which include:

• That the adviser is required to act in the best interests of their client and prioritise their clients interests ahead of their own.

• That any fees are to be disclosed and that the adviser will provide a fee disclosure statement annually.

• That a client has the right to return financial products under 14-day cooling-off period.

• That the client has the right to change his or her instructions to their adviser, if for example they experience a change in their circumstances.

The Government has also agreed to establish an enhanced public register of financial advisers that includes the adviser’s credentials and status within the industry.

“The Palmer United Party will only support FoFA regulations that are unambiguous, transparent and clear,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“It appears that a common-sense approach has prevailed following a successful conversation with the Minister and the diligent work of the Palmer United Senate team which always has the best interests of Australians at heart,” Mr Palmer said.

“We cannot have a FoFA framework that puts ordinary Australian investors at risk, where their retirement plans could be potentially ruined by unscrupulous financial advisors putting their own interests first,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“Our solution for Australians is not the Liberal way or the Labor way, but the right way.”

“We must have a system where the best interests of the clients are taken into account,’’ Mr Palmer said.

I thought it might be helpful and in the public interest to explain the important matters that took place in and around the Australian Senate last week.

During last Wednesday night (9 July), Palmer United senators considered a draft amendment for the repeal of the carbon tax. 
The draft amendment was one which the government and the Palmer United team had negotiated. Based on advice the Palmer United Senate team received on the Wednesday night the position was clear. Any saving brought about by the repeal of the carbon tax would not be mandatorily passed on to the consumers of natural gas and electricity. 

This was not what the Palmer United team wanted. 
If Australian families, industry and citizens were not going to receive a reduction in their electricity and natural gas bills, then the Palmer United Senate team resolved it could not in moral conscience vote to repeal the carbon tax.

The Palmer United team took a positive approach. We redrafted the amendment to deliver reductions to electricity and natural gas consumers from benefits the repeal of the carbon tax would deliver to generators of electricity and producers of natural gas.

The amendment was delivered to the clerk of the Senate office around 8.30am last Thursday morning (10 July), with instructions to circulate the amendment. I personally informed a government minister of the changes. Palmer United senators entered the Senate Chamber believing the amendment would be circulated by the clerk of the Senate office. It wasn’t.

This meant the previous draft was listed as the Palmer United amendment and as the government moved quickly to secure the passage of the amendment and the repeal of the carbon tax without the Palmer United senators’ most recent amendment. 

The situation was discovered by my office in the House of Representatives. I ran from my office to the Senate Chamber and informed Palmer United Senate team of the situation. Why wasn't our 8.30am amendment circulated by the clerk of the senate? I went to find out with members of our team. On encountering representatives of the clerk of the Senate office, I was informed that their view was our amendment was not in accordance with the constitution, so they had decided not to circulate it.

To me it seemed incredible that a public servant would form such a view and not carry out responsibilities to circulate the amendment, and had made no attempt to advise Senator Lazarus that such amendment had not been circulated. This meant the Palmer United team would be voting for a different amendment than the one they thought they were voting for. 

In Australia, our democracy benefits from the separation of powers between the executive, the parliament and the courts. If a public servant can make a declaration that a proposal by an elected representative of the Australian people cannot be discussed in the Senate, the separation of powers and democracy itself is threatened.

I made this clear to the person I encountered and advised them in no uncertain terms that this matter would be referred to the High Court without delay if the amendment was not circulated. I understand a draft was subsequently circulated. I was then told the clerk’s office would advise the President of the Senate to rule it out of order. I took independent advice and based on that advice, and my own legal knowledge and experience, I was able to conclude what the clerk of the Senate office had said and the allegation itself was untrue.

The President of the Senate, to whom the clerk of the Senate reports, is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia. I took the view that the clerk’s office was being manipulated by the Liberal Party, or through time had assumed power it does not have to veto laws before they have been proposed by elected representative of the Australian people. 

I then went back to the Senate to discuss the matter with our senators and on arriving I was confronted with the government’s leaders in the Senate who were taking the line of the clerk’s office.

I pointed out to them that regardless of the clerk’s advice and any ruling from the Liberal Party President of the Senate, the Senate had the power to move a dissent motion from any ruling the president may make. 

They also confirmed to me that irrespective of the clerk’s advice, they had agreed that once the matter was referred back to the House of Representatives there could be no issue. So why not proceed and allow our amendment to be put and supported by the government? 

I concluded that the reason was the government did not actually support the amendment and only wanted to appear to do so. 
I could see no reason why Australian manufacturers should be forced to pay higher costs for power just to give the generators a higher profit, or to save them from poor investment decisions. I could not understand why Australians should be expected to continue to pay higher electricity charges just to make some failing enterprises appear profitable when they lacked the ability to compete in the market.

I suggested the amendment be adopted and I was advised that the Liberal Party would not vote against the proposed ruling of the President of the Senate. I was advised by the government’s leadership in the Senate that Palmer United should vote for the repeal of the carbon tax and the government could consider amendments in the House next week. This was unsatisfactory. I concluded that sincerity is always subject to proof.

I then consulted with my Senate team. It was decided to withdraw the amendment which was now being circulated so as not to waste the Senate’s time and to vote against the government proposal to repeal the carbon tax. 

In so doing we noted the legislation had a start date of the 1st July 2014 and this would not change if the bill was introduced in the lower house the following week. It was too important to the rights and fairness for 23 million Australians to allow them to be forgotten in the rush for cash.

This crisis was brought on by the government. A government which has refused to recognise Palmer United as a political party, despite the fact that Palmer United received 5.6% of the national vote at the last election, while the Deputy Prime Minister’s party, the National Party, only managed 4%. 

This was despite the fact that the Prime Minister only became Prime Minister because he received the Palmer United preferences. This was despite the fact that the Palmer United Party holds the balance of power in the Australian Senate and is the nation’s fourth largest political party. The Prime Minister has the discretion to recognise Palmer United Party as a political party in the parliament, but refuses to do it. 

This means the Palmer United Party members have no party room at Parliament House and have been forced to set up a parliamentary office at the Press Club in Canberra, just so they can meet to discuss proposed bills.

The Greens have around 14 staff attached to the Greens Leader Christine Milne’s office who are able to consider government bills and legislation prior to it being introduced to the Senate. Palmer United has zero staff attached to my office to consider such matters. 

The Greens have a party room at Parliament House and the staff attached to their leader include senior advisors, advisor level classifications and rights to travel across Australia. I have no such staff. I do however occupy the smallest office in the parliament.

The government has the support of many thousands of officers and can swamp senators with detail and endeavour to rob from them of the rights bestowed upon them by the Australian people, which is to exercise their vote in an informed and considered manner. 

Be assured, Palmer United senators will stay true to the people who elected them regardless of any pressure the government or foreign media owners may seek to place upon them. 

Australians must work together so that man can be as he was meant to be; free and independent.

 Kind regards,
 Clive Palmer
