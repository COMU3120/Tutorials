One possible reason that you might not be able to access that group is because of its privacy settings that don't allow open access to the public or bots like Reaper.

2) Yep, that's a great place to start. Make sure you aren't picking articles that only have people being tagged however, just check there are some good comments in there.

In order to get these posts, you have to gather two components, the page id and the post id.

You can get the page id by going to the page on facebook, and copying the name of the page as it appears in the url. Then go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer and put the name that you copied into the textbox that says `GET` and /me etc. Once you submit that, it should display the name of the page, and a number, that number is the page's id.

To get the post id, you need to find the post on facebook, and click the part in gray that's underneath the name of the person who posted it, which says when it was posted. Then look in the url for another number that appears near the end, which is about as long as the page's id, but not the same. This is the post id

Now that you have the page id and post id, you can go to Reaper and use the function 'Comments from post'. The id is the page id, an underscore and the post id.

You can also find the full post id by searching in Reaper. If you look at posts from page, you can download a few thousand of those, then search for the ones that contain the word NRL or whatever you want to look for. Those posts should have the full id already.

Let me know if you need help with any of that

3) Unfortunately, Twitter has many limitations. One of them is that they don't let you search for tweets older than 7 days unless you're looking at a specific user. So even though you increase the number of tweets to download, twitter is only going to allow you to see a limited set of them unless you pay them a bucket of money.",2017-04-16T02:01:40+0000,10155213160081912,Nick Wright,1907889282789720_1921753481403300,,,,,,True,False,0,"Hi Adam, hope you’re having a good Easter. 
I’m struggling to get Reaper to work whenever I try using a specific Facebook page or group and was just wondering why that would be? I have a feeling I’m putting an incorrect page ID in so was just hoping as well you could confirm how to put in certain pages. For instance, a group I’m trying to assess is ‘NRL Sledging: Verbal Warfare’ to see how frequently the Broncos are mentioned and what concepts or terms are related to them.

My other issue is with trying to access news media pieces. I was hoping there would be a way I could use the social media pages of publications such as the Courier Mail, while specifying rugby league and Brisbane Broncos stories and I was just wondering if this was possible and if so/not, how to best go about it?

Last thing I just wanted to confirm was a quick thing with Sublime. Whenever I increase the number of Tweets I want to gather (from 200 to 2000) it only ever gives me 60 rows - is that normal?

This is the link for the page https://www.facebook.com/groups/Sledginglegends/ and I tried to go 'Comments from page's posts' assuming that means it will go through the comment sections of the posts uploaded by the group hosts but it gives me the message 'an error has occurred' after trying to process for a while. 
2) I might need your help with that but I'll give it a crack once I get home and see how I go. 
3) Ah ok that's all good, I think I should be right to just not do the Twitter and focus on the Facebook pages - I have a reddit thread in mind I could use too

""In concept mapping, there is one setting to choose, namely whether to use a linear or gaussian map.The Gaussian map has a more circular symmetry and emphasises the similarity between the conceptual context in which the words appear.  The linear map, by comparison, is more spread out, emphasising the co-occurrence between items. 

...

The conceptual map can be thought of as a birds eye view of the data, displaying the main features (i.e. concepts) and how they interrelate. 

...

In other words, the map is too highly connected, and no strong pattern can be found. The Linear variant of the clustering algorithm is much more stable for highly connected maps, so switching to this setting will often stabilise the map. However, the most important settings which govern the connectedness of the map are the classification thresholds and the size of the coded context block, which are located in the High-Resolution Classification configuration area. If the coded context block is too large, or the high-resolution classification threshold is too low, then each entity will tend to be related to every other entity. The low-resolution bucket size offers a way of indexing longer text segments without increasing connectedness. If you see some highly connected concepts which are effectively bleached of meaning in your data, removing them from the map will usually stabilise the map. These words, such as ‘sort’, ‘think’, and ‘kind’, can often appear in spoken transcripts and may be used as filler words which are essentially stop words. Remember to inspect the actual text locations to check the way these are being used before removing them.In summary, the Linear clustering algorithm is more stable than the Gaussian, but will discover fewer indirect relationships. The cluster map should be considered as indicative and should be used for generating hypotheses for confirmation in the text data. It is not a quantitative statement of fact""",2017-04-17T06:09:37+0000,1465134376882959,Karen Xiao,1907889282789720_1922368968008418,,,,,,True,False,0,"Two questions:

1) Keep woman as a concept, use the women concept to see other concepts related to women (remember to adjust those sliders down the bottom to be able to see more - also change the number of concepts in the concept seeds settings if necessary)

2) Remove the women concept, and make the assumption that most comments are already talking about women (perfectly valid).

There's only one other alt-right-aligned subreddit that I can think of, r/The_Donald, but they are less focused on women's issues.

The issue is that you have equal amounts of data that draw from sources that represent the themes in those sources unequally. Your facebook source mentions women in a very limited way, and your reddit source mentions women nearly exclusively. Because of this, you're going to see the concept of 'women' overwhelming your map.

So you can:

1) Focus exclusively on the women issue. Scrape /r/pussypass and /r/pussypassdenied (maybe others) and analyse that. You may need to remove the woman concept if necessary, but this is allowable.

2) Focus on the alt-right.

1) Yes it's perfectly fine to use just one platform, and if you can draw significant conclusions from it (see Assignment 2 rubric), then it's a perfectly valid amount of data

2) If you feel like seperate maps are better, then you can use seperate maps. Make sure you justify why and consider its limitations. You can increase the number of concepts that Leximancer extracts by editing the Concept Seeds Settings if that makes combining data easier

3) Use whichever tags you think help to identify the most useful conclusions, date and time might have a bearing on the data, and it might not (I wouldn't think so in this case). Also consider reducing the tags for likes to categories rather than numbers (no likes, low likes, medium likes etc.) That way you can talk about which opinions the community feels are the most representative of their views.

If you want to change how it looks, consider reducing the number of visible concepts or changing the view to Gaussian

4) The task sheet is the 'final word' on this. ""quotes and references are not included in word count"". So unless Dan corrects me, you should operate under the assumption that they do unless they are a quote or reference.

And yes, please include information from the insight dashboard that you find relevant, but use your own tables - no screenshots

5) Appendixes are not fun to read so if you omit it, I won't miss it :P

Great work, best of luck with the rest of your report",2017-04-17T14:48:10+0000,10213524667057882,Stacey Chin,1907889282789720_1922544917990823,,,,,,True,False,0,"Hi Adam and Dan, hope you all had a lovely Easter. So I’m not sure if what I’m doing is correct, and just want to make sure that I’m on the right track. 

1.    So I have downloaded data from Facebook (a feminism-related video posted on 4 different Facebook pages – for e.g. Refinery29, The Guardian Australia, Channel 4 News and AJ+) in which I’ve chosen to look at the video’s comments. I'd like to analyse the language/views/attitudes of the users about it. I’ve downloaded the data of the video posted on each of the 4 different FB pages separately, and all 4 of it totals to around 4000-5000plus rows of data. Is this sufficient? Or do I need to use other social media platforms like YouTube/Reddit to compare as well? Or can I just stick to this and focus on FB? 

2. I’m also wondering how I should go about doing the concept map on Leximancer, as all the 4 FB video’s comments of data were downloaded as separate CSV files. Should I combine the 4 csv file documents together and then generate the concept map (so it’s like all in one)? Or can I do an individual concept map, for each of the 4? It’s just that if I combine everything, the concept map will look very messy and disorganised, and some content/themes might go missing/or be hard to see too (as I’ve tried this already). 

3. With reference to the attached concept map images (this is just an individual concept map from 1 of the 4 FB pages I used), as there are a lot of likes counts and comments counts in the Facebook data; should I merge them together (merge all the likes counts into one, and comments counts into one) or just leave this as it is? Is it necessary for me to put in the date and time as tags into the concept map as well? Or will this be too much, and instead make the map too overcrowded? It looks clustered, and I’m not sure how to make them look more organised or easier to see to read. The attached images are a before and after of adding in the like counts and comment counts tags. 

4. Just to clarify (sorry if these have been asked before), do words in the tables we create, and words in the concept maps count towards the word count? Also, we are not allowed to screenshot the insights dashboard and put them into our report right? But we can use the content from the insights dashboard and put them into our own created tables? Lastly, is the Appendix necessary in the report? Or can we exclude that out if we don’t need it? 

Thank you so much for your patience and time in answering these truckloads of qns! Really most appreciated! :)",,,,,,,0,NONE,,,,,

I didn't know I could increase the no. of concepts by doing that, as I usually just adjust the percentage of visibility and theme concepts of the maps. 3) Yeah, I don't think time and date has much of an effect on the comments either, so it's fine for me to exclude that then? Oh, thanks for the suggestion about the likes. I'll rename the likes tags and change them to that manner, (which also reduces them a little as well) as I agree that would be more helpful. 4) Okays, so we don't necessarily have to show all the concepts in the map then? The concept map mostly acts as a visual aspect for you guys to see the overview/overall picture right? N noted, will stick to the Gaussian, which is the social network view right? 5) Yay, okay thanks a lot, Adam! Oh, and sorry just two more questions: 6) Is it ok if we quote/reference from some (maybe 1-2) news articles (which are relevant to the video), and put them into our report? As they could help provide supplementary information, and serve as an analysis as well? Or should we just mostly rely on our computational data?  7) So do we reference the Sublime, OpenRefine, Leximancer softwares in our references section? And is there an APA style to reference such softwares (I rmb this has been asked before, but I'm still a little unsure)? And in my case, followed by the 4 Facebook pages' video links? Many thanks for answering my qns again! :)",2017-04-17T14:48:10+0000,10213524667057882,Stacey Chin,1907889282789720_1922544917990823,,,,,,True,False,0,"Hi Adam and Dan, hope you all had a lovely Easter. So I’m not sure if what I’m doing is correct, and just want to make sure that I’m on the right track. 

1.    So I have downloaded data from Facebook (a feminism-related video posted on 4 different Facebook pages – for e.g. Refinery29, The Guardian Australia, Channel 4 News and AJ+) in which I’ve chosen to look at the video’s comments. I'd like to analyse the language/views/attitudes of the users about it. I’ve downloaded the data of the video posted on each of the 4 different FB pages separately, and all 4 of it totals to around 4000-5000plus rows of data. Is this sufficient? Or do I need to use other social media platforms like YouTube/Reddit to compare as well? Or can I just stick to this and focus on FB? 

2. I’m also wondering how I should go about doing the concept map on Leximancer, as all the 4 FB video’s comments of data were downloaded as separate CSV files. Should I combine the 4 csv file documents together and then generate the concept map (so it’s like all in one)? Or can I do an individual concept map, for each of the 4? It’s just that if I combine everything, the concept map will look very messy and disorganised, and some content/themes might go missing/or be hard to see too (as I’ve tried this already). 

3. With reference to the attached concept map images (this is just an individual concept map from 1 of the 4 FB pages I used), as there are a lot of likes counts and comments counts in the Facebook data; should I merge them together (merge all the likes counts into one, and comments counts into one) or just leave this as it is? Is it necessary for me to put in the date and time as tags into the concept map as well? Or will this be too much, and instead make the map too overcrowded? It looks clustered, and I’m not sure how to make them look more organised or easier to see to read. The attached images are a before and after of adding in the like counts and comment counts tags. 

4. Just to clarify (sorry if these have been asked before), do words in the tables we create, and words in the concept maps count towards the word count? Also, we are not allowed to screenshot the insights dashboard and put them into our report right? But we can use the content from the insights dashboard and put them into our own created tables? Lastly, is the Appendix necessary in the report? Or can we exclude that out if we don’t need it? 

Thank you so much for your patience and time in answering these truckloads of qns! Really most appreciated! :)",,,,,,,0,NONE,2017-04-17T14:59:01+0000,1293877904015202,Adam Smith,1922548957990419,"Great stuff!

1) Yes it's perfectly fine to use just one platform, and if you can draw significant conclusions from it (see Assignment 2 rubric), then it's a perfectly valid amount of data

2) If you feel like seperate maps are better, then you can use seperate maps. Make sure you justify why and consider its limitations. You can increase the number of concepts that Leximancer extracts by editing the Concept Seeds Settings if that makes combining data easier

3) Use whichever tags you think help to identify the most useful conclusions, date and time might have a bearing on the data, and it might not (I wouldn't think so in this case). Also consider reducing the tags for likes to categories rather than numbers (no likes, low likes, medium likes etc.) That way you can talk about which opinions the community feels are the most representative of their views.

If you want to change how it looks, consider reducing the number of visible concepts or changing the view to Gaussian

4) The task sheet is the 'final word' on this. ""quotes and references are not included in word count"". So unless Dan corrects me, you should operate under the assumption that they do unless they are a quote or reference.

And yes, please include information from the insight dashboard that you find relevant, but use your own tables - no screenshots

5) Appendixes are not fun to read so if you omit it, I won't miss it :P

Great work, best of luck with the rest of your report"

This goes for everyone reading - Don't be afraid to do a deep dive with this, and don't be afraid to go looking without a goal in-mind.

What subreddit(s) are you scraping from and how are the threads sorted? That'll give me an idea about what options you have.

You're right that if you use too many rows, you begin to dilute concepts and loose any intelligible meaning. I noticed a similar phenomena when looking at hundreds of thousands of comments from multiple subreddits in Leximancer. 

Think of it like following someone around and taking notes on things they say. If you took notes for a day, you could draw some interesting conclusions with just the text alone, the same could be said for a week maybe. But over a year or 10, or 50, there's just too much data and eventually most the concepts and themes even out. Vsauce has a really cool video about word frequency which is only tangentially related but I find it really interesting :P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE

Here are three of your options: (Daniel Angus may be able to chime in with more or correct me if I'm wrong)

1 - Use your own concept list:

You mentioned this already, and it is something that I found success with personally. This assignment isn't necessarily about downloading a bunch of stuff, chucking it in Leximancer and then getting something cool back, it's about using qualitative analysis techniques. If you can do the due diligence of analysing the source of the data itself, coming up with some key themes and concepts that you would like to investigate, and then submitting that to Leximancer, then that is something I would encourage you to do.

Reddit provides a great way to look back at the top threads over time if you sort by top - so what I would recommend is going to https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITNAME/top/?sort=top&t=all (assuming you scraped the top threads of all time - adjust if you did differently). From there, open every comment link on that page and spend some time reading through the comments and taking notes. This'll help you get an idea of what topics of conversation are important. Do the same again but get the top threads this month etc.

From there you should be able to build you own concept list that you can give to Leximancer. Just delete all the Auto Concepts, and add your own in the User Concepts. Make sure you've got AT LEAST 20 concepts to map.

2 - Tweak Leximancer settings:

Leximancer has default settings that use what I as a programmer would call ""magic numbers"", numbers that have no derivable meaning to the layman and in Leximancer's case, are used because they most often produce results that are about right (and I assume are backed up by linguistic theory). In your case, they aren't about right, so they might need some tweaking.

Have a go at adjusting the Concept Seeds Settings, the Thesaurus Settings, the Concept Coding Settings, and the Project Output Settings. You may find that by changing frequencies, weights and thresholds, you'll get data that better reflects the state of the subreddit

3 - Use more descriptive data

I'll use the above analogy of following someone around and taking notes.

If you followed them for a year and took notes in a stream-of-consciousness style and there weren't any paragraphs or contextualizing information, Leximancer can't do much with it. As mentioned, concepts begin to dilute as frequencies are evened out over time. However, if you took notes that contained more contextualizing information, you can definitely derive interesting conclusions. You could see how the person conversed at different times of the day, or with different people, or in different locations, or at different mood levels etc.

The data you have right now comes with a lot of metadata that's just taking up space and not being used by Leximancer, but you can put it to work in Leximancer with some slight adjustments. In the 'Auto Tags' tab of the Concept Seeds, you will probably see that Leximancer has identified useful metadata already.

I showed an example in one workshop of my analysis of this Facebook Group. I added tags for posts and comments that got a high number of likes and comments, tags for comments made by Dan and myself, and tags for different times of day (similar to what Dan did with the QandA data). You can use these tags from the existing data (or add your own - let me know if you'd like some ideas on how to do that) to help Leximancer place more importance on concepts that are associated with these tags, and derive more interesting conclusions from them.

A note on this however - be careful that your analysis is still qualitative not quantitative. Eg. 

Good: Comments that mentioned Obama were classified as highly up-voted while that mentioned Trump were not

From there, open every comment link on that page and spend some time reading through the comments and taking notes. This'll help you get an idea of what topics of conversation are important. Do the same again but get the top threads this month etc.

From there you should be able to build you own concept list that you can give to Leximancer. Just delete all the Auto Concepts, and add your own in the User Concepts. Make sure you've got AT LEAST 20 concepts to map.

2 - Tweak Leximancer settings:

Leximancer has default settings that use what I as a programmer would call ""magic numbers"", numbers that have no derivable meaning to the layman and in Leximancer's case, are used because they most often produce results that are about right (and I assume are backed up by linguistic theory). In your case, they aren't about right, so they might need some tweaking.

Have a go at adjusting the Concept Seeds Settings, the Thesaurus Settings, the Concept Coding Settings, and the Project Output Settings. You may find that by changing frequencies, weights and thresholds, you'll get data that better reflects the state of the subreddit

3 - Use more descriptive data

I'll use the above analogy of following someone around and taking notes.

If you followed them for a year and took notes in a stream-of-consciousness style and there weren't any paragraphs or contextualizing information, Leximancer can't do much with it. As mentioned, concepts begin to dilute as frequencies are evened out over time. However, if you took notes that contained more contextualizing information, you can definitely derive interesting conclusions. You could see how the person conversed at different times of the day, or with different people, or in different locations, or at different mood levels etc.

The data you have right now comes with a lot of metadata that's just taking up space and not being used by Leximancer, but you can put it to work in Leximancer with some slight adjustments. In the 'Auto Tags' tab of the Concept Seeds, you will probably see that Leximancer has identified useful metadata already.

I showed an example in one workshop of my analysis of this Facebook Group. I added tags for posts and comments that got a high number of likes and comments, tags for comments made by Dan and myself, and tags for different times of day (similar to what Dan did with the QandA data). You can use these tags from the existing data (or add your own - let me know if you'd like some ideas on how to do that) to help Leximancer place more importance on concepts that are associated with these tags, and derive more interesting conclusions from them.

A note on this however - be careful that your analysis is still qualitative not quantitative. Eg. 

Good: Comments that mentioned Obama were classified as highly up-voted while that mentioned Trump were not

Bad: Comments that mentioned Obama and Trump received on average 13 and 3 upvotes respectively.

Is it possible I have too much data and I'm just overwhelming Leximancer? I wanted to make sure it had plenty of data to read because before I tried analysing a series of Tweets under the hashtag #offendeveryonein4words and it couldn't make head or tail of that because the Tweets were too short.

Really confused why I'm not getting any decent concepts popping up, especially when I followed the same procedure as a friend I live with and her concept map has plenty of relevant items. Would really appreciate some assistance! :)

How do you increase the default thread number? I put in 500 and it only spat out 101 haha",2017-04-15T04:49:21+0000,10155284333557431,Emily Muirhead,1907889282789720_1921286734783308,,,,,,True,False,0,"So I'm having a lot of trouble with the Leximancer analysis.

I've cleaned the two files I'm using (which is data from a subreddit), uploaded them to Leximancer, added the English stoplist and attempted to generate a concept list. However, every time I go back to look at my auto-generated concept list, it's full of kind of... nothing words. Everyday words that don't make a heap of sense as ""concepts"", and the only name-like concept they've included is the word ""edit"", which... yeah look not sure how they pulled that out.

I'm definitely not short of data that has some significant concepts in it; I have close to 90,000 rows of comments in the subreddit's threads as well as 900 rows which include the thread titles, many of which include some pretty major themes and frequently use words that should come up in the analysis.

If I try to manually add my own concepts, there's thousands of them, so I don't understand why they're not coming up in the auto-generated concept list.

Is it possible I have too much data and I'm just overwhelming Leximancer? I wanted to make sure it had plenty of data to read because before I tried analysing a series of Tweets under the hashtag #offendeveryonein4words and it couldn't make head or tail of that because the Tweets were too short.

Really confused why I'm not getting any decent concepts popping up, especially when I followed the same procedure as a friend I live with and her concept map has plenty of relevant items. Would really appreciate some assistance! :)

TLDR: I have a bunch of meaningless concept words coming up in the auto-generated concept list and my map is making very little sense. Help please.

I've attached a screenshot of part of the concept list if that helps. :)",,,,,,,0,NONE,2017-04-15T05:42:20+0000,1293877904015202,Adam Smith,1921316748113640,"First of all, fantastic searching process! You've managed to extract a lot data which is great, and I'm certain that you'll be able to find something interesting from it.

What subreddit(s) are you scraping from and how are the threads sorted? That'll give me an idea about what options you have.

You're right that if you use too many rows, you begin to dilute concepts and loose any intelligible meaning. I noticed a similar phenomena when looking at hundreds of thousands of comments from multiple subreddits in Leximancer. 

Think of it like following someone around and taking notes on things they say. If you took notes for a day, you could draw some interesting conclusions with just the text alone, the same could be said for a week maybe. But over a year or 10, or 50, there's just too much data and eventually most the concepts and themes even out. Vsauce has a really cool video about word frequency which is only tangentially related but I find it really interesting :P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE

Here are three of your options: (Daniel Angus may be able to chime in with more or correct me if I'm wrong)

1 - Use your own concept list:

You mentioned this already, and it is something that I found success with personally. This assignment isn't necessarily about downloading a bunch of stuff, chucking it in Leximancer and then getting something cool back, it's about using qualitative analysis techniques. If you can do the due diligence of analysing the source of the data itself, coming up with some key themes and concepts that you would like to investigate, and then submitting that to Leximancer, then that is something I would encourage you to do.

Reddit provides a great way to look back at the top threads over time if you sort by top - so what I would recommend is going to https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITNAME/top/?sort=top&t=all (assuming you scraped the top threads of all time - adjust if you did differently). From there, open every comment link on that page and spend some time reading through the comments and taking notes. This'll help you get an idea of what topics of conversation are important. Do the same again but get the top threads this month etc.

From there you should be able to build you own concept list that you can give to Leximancer. Just delete all the Auto Concepts, and add your own in the User Concepts. Make sure you've got AT LEAST 20 concepts to map.

2 - Tweak Leximancer settings:

Leximancer has default settings that use what I as a programmer would call ""magic numbers"", numbers that have no derivable meaning to the layman and in Leximancer's case, are used because they most often produce results that are about right (and I assume are backed up by linguistic theory). In your case, they aren't about right, so they might need some tweaking.

Have a go at adjusting the Concept Seeds Settings, the Thesaurus Settings, the Concept Coding Settings, and the Project Output Settings. You may find that by changing frequencies, weights and thresholds, you'll get data that better reflects the state of the subreddit

3 - Use more descriptive data

I'll use the above analogy of following someone around and taking notes.

If you followed them for a year and took notes in a stream-of-consciousness style and there weren't any paragraphs or contextualizing information, Leximancer can't do much with it. As mentioned, concepts begin to dilute as frequencies are evened out over time. However, if you took notes that contained more contextualizing information, you can definitely derive interesting conclusions. You could see how the person conversed at different times of the day, or with different people, or in different locations, or at different mood levels etc.

The data you have right now comes with a lot of metadata that's just taking up space and not being used by Leximancer, but you can put it to work in Leximancer with some slight adjustments. In the 'Auto Tags' tab of the Concept Seeds, you will probably see that Leximancer has identified useful metadata already.

I showed an example in one workshop of my analysis of this Facebook Group. I added tags for posts and comments that got a high number of likes and comments, tags for comments made by Dan and myself, and tags for different times of day (similar to what Dan did with the QandA data). You can use these tags from the existing data (or add your own - let me know if you'd like some ideas on how to do that) to help Leximancer place more importance on concepts that are associated with these tags, and derive more interesting conclusions from them.

A note on this however - be careful that your analysis is still qualitative not quantitative. Eg. 

Good: Comments that mentioned Obama were classified as highly up-voted while that mentioned Trump were not

A few of you have been asking us how to remove many columns from csv files at once. Unfortunately this is not possible in OpenRefine without manually selecting each column that you want to delete. 

To solve this, I wrote a new piece of software on Saturday to remove columns in bulk really easily: https://github.com/ScriptSmith/csveditor/

There are instructions on how to use and download it on that page. It's very simple to use and it functions in the same way as Reaper which you are all familiar with. If you have any questions or issues when using it, write a comment on this post and I'll get back to you.

This is a new experience for a lot of you and we don't expect you to initially understand what information you might be able to find when beginning your investigation.

You may think now that there is some information that is not relevant to things you might want to do in the future, but the danger of removing things that you consider irrelevant is that if you change your mind and do want to use that information later, or want to gather more information based on your current data set, or realize that the data has a different meaning to what you thought it did, it can be difficult / impossible to get deleted data back.

Trailing and leading whitespace usually originates from human error, so you only need to trim those columns that contain data specifically added by a user like a tweet or comment's body, or a first and last name",2017-03-26T05:31:37+0000,1675395689144186,Georgia Young,1907889282789720_1910747965837185,,,,,,True,False,0,"Hi guys, just wanted to clarify what data columns our final cleaned data sets should include. I know we are meant to delete columns with no values. However, there are a lot columns that contain data that would seemingly be irrelevant if we were to undertake an analysis. I'm aware this assignment isn't about analysis, but is a 'cleaned' data set considered to be one that keeps future data analysis in mind by removing this irrelevant data, or one that keeps all the scraped data and simply cleans it?

We ask that you delete empty columns because they by their very nature cannot provide any information and so they are useless in other software.

You may think now that there is some information that is not relevant to things you might want to do in the future, but the danger of removing things that you consider irrelevant is that if you change your mind and do want to use that information later, or want to gather more information based on your current data set, or realize that the data has a different meaning to what you thought it did, it can be difficult / impossible to get deleted data back.

Instead when we're using this software, we work with a limited view of the data derived from the main data that you can specify. So the whole data-set still exists on your computer, but as you are analyzing and manipulating you decide which parts are used by the program or seen on the screen.

Hope that helps :D"
